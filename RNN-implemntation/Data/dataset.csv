Strength and resolve but the food for its ire,Iambic
Occasioned its torment when I just a child,Iambic
Knew in its object the beast 'neath my bed,Iambic
Its cold breath of reason haunting the gloom,Iambic
Years like a sponge sopping horror and awe,Iambic
Futile the struggle to see through its veil,Iambic
Til in mid age through no fault but my own,Iambic
Death showed its visage my flesh in its teeth,Iambic
Spit in my face matter clotted as truth,Iambic
Then as I rinsed the red stain from my skin,Iambic
Wrapped me in angel wings tender and warm,Iambic
Filled me with quiet and whispered my ear,Iambic
That I'd not be wary the darkness again,Iambic
For o'er my head swam an ocean of stars,Iambic
But only revealed in night's deepest black,Iambic
Just as the true light of Heaven is known,Iambic
Only in Death's dark eternal embrace,Iambic
We are not what am working to so hard,Iambic
We never a peer like bud and tendril,Iambic
Dealing with the terms odd and skewed enough,Iambic
I am dying of a world of fright ,Iambic
I know as we would not hold anymore,Iambic
I am keeping on and on dear me oh!,Iambic
I fear being lone loveless daisy,Iambic
Now that I am merely staying,Iambic
Weary of those smiles rotten,Iambic
Hollow dreams promises empty frail pleas,Iambic
Hiding fears clinging tears blowing north wind,Iambic
Oh! things are badly  stopped Some light I pray,Iambic
We not are pretend what too cleverly,Iambic
Never were together there we never!,Iambic
Little ball of fur ,Iambic
Listen to the purr,Iambic
Dangle string and,Iambic
See the kitty sway,Iambic
Focused on its prey,Iambic
Feel legs bunch and,Iambic
See the kitty pounce,Iambic
as dark a night has fallen from an autumn day,Iambic
and if you listen to the rustled breeze,Iambic
you may hear voices somewhere in the trees,Iambic
but never look for them  they're only there to play,Iambic
and reaching out to take that first and bonding kiss,Iambic
the world of separationists refused them this,Iambic
and everyone was watching them until,Iambic
for everyone resented love they couldn't know,Iambic
and he took to the whip he'd taken from,Iambic
so town folk layed some timber to a fire,Iambic
The flames consumed as if love spared them misery,Iambic
and so they all jumped in for sake of agony,Iambic
And only love survived this horrid frightful night,Iambic
if you've a mind to listen to the sound,Iambic
Sweet is the taste of days from yesteryear,Iambic
that haunt the heart so keenly they bring tears,Iambic
as time passed on and age ceased not to gain,Iambic
Sweet were the summers when you as a child,Iambic
ate popsicles and hula hooped a while,Iambic
and Christmases came with a little snow,Iambic
as sparkling trees had shiny gifts below,Iambic
Sweet was the past when youth was still in bloom,Iambic
and passion was a glance across the room,Iambic
from someone’s face you’d see for all your life,Iambic
from someone’s face who’d choose you for a wife,Iambic
Sweet is the thought of moments now gone by,Iambic
that pass across the mind and bring a sigh,Iambic
memories floating on life’s gentle breeze,Iambic
recalling mainly those that often please,Iambic
I'd walk down through the forest in the rain,Iambic
to see the girl in green and feel her pain,Iambic
uncertain of her life so many ways,Iambic
yet outwardly she'd laugh throughout the days,Iambic
All dressed in greenery of vine and leaves,Iambic
she'd dance and sing there in our greenery,Iambic
She teased me every morning in her way,Iambic
right next to you but far back in the trees,Iambic
nor tries to understand what I can't show,Iambic
the me they never see and do not know,Iambic
The images of her are with me yet,Iambic
as part of me and what I'll not forget,Iambic
but then one day I blinked and she was gone,Iambic
I could not ask of her to anyone,Iambic
for she lived over there  back through the trees,Iambic
Stealing our comfort disguised as bliss,Iambic
Will make you do what you thought you missed,Iambic
So once again repeat the act then label it,Iambic
A truth or fact,Iambic
The truth it can be for a time but then you run to the end of the line,Iambic
A fact is born from way beyond ,Iambic
It too will snap before very long,Iambic
Confusion blossoms as you can't decide,Iambic
To open the door or stay inside,Iambic
The wandering of a lost soul has for now a very tight hold,Iambic
Black as night white as snow just follow it where it as it goes,Iambic
Skim the top and leave the rest,Iambic
You can decide what comes next,Iambic
In the light clouds will flow and on the path you will stroll,Iambic
Rocks catch the foot and heel collide it doesn't matter the path is wide,Iambic
Spinning now like a top the sounds your hearing as you drop,Iambic
Liquid spilling all around your heart was beating as you touch the ground,Iambic
Stealing our comfort,Iambic
Disguised as bliss,Iambic
Will make you do what you thought you missed,Iambic
So once again repeat the act now not remembering if it is truth or fact,Iambic
Songwriters set their words about her style,Iambic
and artists make pursuit to paint her smile,Iambic
her heart and soul to only those,Iambic
who come to fall in love for just while,Iambic
and she is just a memory,Iambic
if time was mine and not a thing that flies,Iambic
I trace my blood and line of ancestry,Iambic
down through some troubled times of history,Iambic
or is it that I've journeyed long,Iambic
from when my life went all so wrong,Iambic
Am I my father who's still growing old,Iambic
or has she layed our love to times' unfold?,Iambic
or where one day the guillotine,Iambic
O! I would lay my neck under the blade,Iambic
if there would ever be a diff'rence made,Iambic
to end the pain she left in me,Iambic
and stop the love for my Marie,Iambic
but love  this love for her can never fade,Iambic
I wait and wander by the Seine,Iambic
While searching for my younger self one day,Iambic
I rambled through the boxes of my youth                ,Iambic
to waken recollections buried there,Iambic
I saw the dauntless smile of years ago,Iambic
The glass tossed back the face I'd come to know,Iambic
It really wasn’t wrinkles on my face,Iambic
or graying hair that made me look away,Iambic
My smile had changed from bright and genuine ,Iambic
revealing joy but also showing wear,Iambic
brought on by age I’m glad for moments spent,Iambic
with photos of a time that seemed sublime,Iambic
I’m thankful I can smile most days because,Iambic
of inner peace and changes wrought by time,Iambic
but soon the subconscious starts to so weep,Iambic
the rotten/rotting truth into the deep,Iambic
of mind and body those slow seconds seep,Iambic
cancerous cells into a heart of sick,Iambic
carves their own epitaph before they die,Iambic
THE GREAT AMERICAN RACIST,Iambic
I stand my ground and white is what is me,Iambic
as fair a man as there could ever be,Iambic
I'll not apologize to anyone,Iambic
for what the world's dependent on,Iambic
Excuses come from those who ever fail,Iambic
or educated by their time in jail,Iambic
and racist it may be,Iambic
but it's the side of me,Iambic
the die's been cast and juries set the stage,Iambic
and let out are the crazies from their cage,Iambic
while whites proclaim all guilt from high,Iambic
and others only live the lie,Iambic
expecting things to change because of rage,Iambic
Whose knife has cut the thread once meant to bind,Iambic
depriving all the love there is to find?,Iambic
The greatest tragedy of all,Iambic
is when our backs are to the wall  ,Iambic
Abbreviated by an early autumn night,Iambic
give reason to all things the heat and time has done,Iambic
the fences seperating everything we know,Iambic
in love and prayer that times like this always will bring,Iambic
Come life and death of it you blessed rhapsody,Iambic
you've played for long enough and now it's time to go,Iambic
there's not a better time than now to let it be,Iambic
insanities its own and best reward you know,Iambic
deep in the night while there's no certain thing,Iambic
but passion for the grief that lingers on and on,Iambic
as damp and cold as fog as hot as summers sting,Iambic
come life and death of it before this act is gone,Iambic
there must be question to the ends uncertainty,Iambic
and is the act onstage or what the actors see,Iambic
beyond the blinding light among the walking dead,Iambic
who come to be amused right through our greatest fear,Iambic
of no aplause or laughter where there should be none,Iambic
and we must speak each word for everyone to hear,Iambic
exactly as they plan so that the show goes on,Iambic
and yes they knew the end before the curtain call,Iambic
but made production's costs a thing to bear,Iambic
and every star that's in the sky could surely fall,Iambic
from how it shines tonnight unless the fire is there,Iambic
they cannot see the moving of the props around,Iambic
nor setting of the stage  this is our holy ground,Iambic
the tinting of each face the tightening of waist,Iambic
there no one dares to tread except for those who see,Iambic
the detail of it all must blend into the play,Iambic
the making up must be complete in every way,Iambic
we must not let the ending go beyond the end,Iambic
or all is lost and all we'll hear is mumbelings ,Iambic
and lack of press where there has never been a friend,Iambic
so life and death of it come down though pain it brings,Iambic
let not the curtain to ascend the play is done,Iambic
and weary are the actors they've performed quite well,Iambic
as real as life so now the show must not go on,Iambic
past curtain fall there's nothing more we have to tell,Iambic
A quiet storm is raging in my head,Iambic
Confusion is what’s left of the debris,Iambic
A lifeless lump contains an empty soul,Iambic
A heart bereft of love will tempt the clouds,Iambic
I’ll not survive the darkness and the rain,Iambic
Nothing will grow where love does not exist,Iambic
A quiet storm is raging in my head,Iambic
Sarajevo   UNDER A LINDEN TREE,Iambic
The morning lights and to another day,Iambic
a pirate's chest you've found but will not stay,Iambic
for longer than the blinking of your eye,Iambic
from troubled sleep to wake wherein you die,Iambic
through every ticking second where you are,Iambic
as dense and far away as any star,Iambic
you sit and let your life and time run out,Iambic
and have become what others talk about,Iambic
the need for firewood made it days gone by,Iambic
but still you want to hear how love can't die,Iambic
from time to time you'll always hear a clue,Iambic
between each word that's meant for only you,Iambic
coincidental to what you have seen,Iambic
you take it in as how each word must mean,Iambic
and this will guide you through the whole day long,Iambic
as certain as the hearing of Our Song,Iambic
just at the proper timing of your need,Iambic
you cling to it and make it what must be,Iambic
the fabric of your life and prophesy,Iambic
and it will carry you from here to there,Iambic
into another day that goes no where,Iambic
Nakalalaside a clear blue water lake,Iambic
The labyrinth of streams the water takes,Iambic
Colorful fish seek shelter in the shade,Iambic
Night breezes make sparks rise and shadows dance,Iambic
A night time serenade in Bullfrog Valley,Iambic
The orange glow turns into white hot ash,Iambic
The moon provides the light in nature's galley,Iambic
She sat on the rocks looking out at the water,Iambic
The sun reached across and she smiled as it caught her,Iambic
She picked up a pebble that stood out in the sand,Iambic
And fingered it lightly as it lay in her hand,Iambic
It was daring like him to sparkle so brightly,Iambic
She stared at it long then held it tightly,Iambic
She stared at the water as the sky went dim,Iambic
Then threw in the rock for the rock was like him,Iambic
and shake up the flow,Iambic
And only be me,Iambic
never stick up my nose,Iambic
and always be kind,Iambic
that I always cared,Iambic
and see where it goes,Iambic
and never think that Sarajevo hasn't named the song,Iambic
our fear has brought it down on a world going wrong,Iambic
The last of everyone's been written in our rage,Iambic
The pain of feeling helpless is so great,Iambic
It pricks the heart like needles in the snow,Iambic
If I could cure the sadness that you feel,Iambic
Their hazel beauty now a black tableau,Iambic
I too can feel the sting of your torment,Iambic
It pricks my heart like needles in the snow,Iambic
he waits to see some more of who you are,Iambic
your love is just as dead as he has been,Iambic
not caring it's your fate the guillotine,Iambic
not caring how you cried yourself to sleep,Iambic
are all his love has seen with his own eyes,Iambic
but shadows hide your death there on the wall,Iambic
delivering his shiny blade to who you are,Iambic
They're all a cleansing for a jumbled mind,Iambic
a brushing of cobwebs and molded dew,Iambic
that genus Saprolegnia we find,Iambic
deep in the very darkest part of you,Iambic
releasing of the energy in rage,Iambic
that's multiplied by love or love gone wrong,Iambic
escape from life that has become a cage,Iambic
or clinging to what you have loved so long,Iambic
in people as they look at you and stare,Iambic
they're wondering why do you look at me?,Iambic
and never recognize what you are seeing there,Iambic
But you have truth they'll never understand,Iambic
what God has made is going as it's planned,Iambic
Songwriters set their words about her style,Iambic
and artists make pursuit to paint her smile,Iambic
her heart and soul to only those,Iambic
who come to fall in love for just while,Iambic
and she is just a memory,Iambic
if time was mine and not a thing that flies,Iambic
I trace my blood and line of ancestry,Iambic
down through some troubled times of history,Iambic
or is it that I've journeyed long,Iambic
from when my life went all so wrong,Iambic
Am I my father who's still growing old,Iambic
or has she layed our love to times' unfold?,Iambic
or where one day the guillotine,Iambic
O! I would lay my neck under the blade,Iambic
if there would ever be a diff'rence made,Iambic
to end the pain she left in me,Iambic
and stop the love for my Marie,Iambic
but love  this love for her can never fade,Iambic
I wait and wander by the Seine,Iambic
Too many times I've seen you almost smile,Iambic
for you to think of me and almost smile,Iambic
My emptiness was almost in your eyes,Iambic
But rivers run too deep and that is me,Iambic
but I was never someone in your eyes,Iambic
So many times I've seen you almost cry,Iambic
and I still love the way you almost cry,Iambic
Too many times I've seen you almost smile,Iambic
and I will not forget your almost smile,Iambic
Somewhere in my constant thought of you,Iambic
are secrets of the past I never knew,Iambic
and things about your life nobody knows,Iambic
the silver lining of a troubled sky,Iambic
Out of a mist you showed up misty eyed,Iambic
I wonder at the many times you've cried,Iambic
for reason that the heart can never see,Iambic
and have resolved myself to go the way,Iambic
of never having you forever All the same,Iambic
and I will never come to understand,Iambic
just why I love you so my heart's big cime,Iambic
but this is something that will never go,Iambic
though you will be a part of everything I ever do,Iambic
Tomorrow’s dreams beneath my pillow sit,Iambic
Orchestral prayers unwind the years ago,Iambic
Uncovered only one way back to you,Iambic
Conviction drew your soul’s celestial arc,Iambic
His light still shines upon a narrow path,Iambic
Lay forth in front of me my will and soul,Iambic
To speak of such things to occur are told,Iambic
Now turning my attention to myself,Iambic
As I have come into this world alone,Iambic
I've made and lost close friends along the way,Iambic
Always shall we move through this universe,Iambic
Come hail or shine we will remain in time,Iambic
A blue daisy my love I offer you,Iambic
Don't search for my heart for I've lost it now,Iambic
A new day shall dawn for you and your life,Iambic
And new memories be made just for you,Iambic
Never realizing life the real dream,Iambic
As one petal falls a new one shall grow,Iambic
I wash my cup and saucer and admire,Iambic
their elegance and pleasing shade of blue,Iambic
the popular Blue Daisy Company,Iambic
Blue daisy plants don't flourish where I live,Iambic
for me I'm death to flowers! So I have,Iambic
the artificial ones They look alive!,Iambic
Most of my rooms are graced with vases of,Iambic
these blue silk beauties that appeal to my,Iambic
of whimsy Then they make me smile and sigh,Iambic
you need time to dress up AND to undress!,Iambic
Your dainty negligee's there to entice,Iambic
And God forbid if you've no time to preen,Iambic
That you will shine at work and then at play,Iambic
You get between the sheets and sweetly sigh,Iambic
And should you wake from sleep and need some cheer,Iambic
the kind that man all need from ladies dear,Iambic
and put away each dish and pot and pan,Iambic
I need to rush to work to serve my boss,Iambic
Perhaps I'll get back home by half past six,Iambic
In time to add some nuts to patty mix!,Iambic
and aging nightmares clash with youthful dreams,Iambic
It's hard to be a woman rub those heels!,Iambic
It's hard to be a woman and play dumb,Iambic
So's not to scare the macho minded chum,Iambic
It's hard to be a woman and appease,Iambic
I'll spread that peanut butter and that jam,Iambic
But I'll not hide the fire in my soul,Iambic
that eyes are watching everywhere I go,Iambic
No one can be a woman quite like me!!!,Iambic
An epiphanic moment,Iambic
Pale dew drops clung to silky petals as,Iambic
light breeze held wispy branchlets in its sway,Iambic
soon settling into ripples teasing seas,Iambic
while mountains stood agape tall silhouettes,Iambic
of   sand   immortalised in castle shapes,Iambic
Bronze temple bells chimed  mellific  sweet tones,Iambic
hymns circumambulated God's grand thrones,Iambic
who poured their  munificent boons across,Iambic
the  yearning ambience without restraint,Iambic
Time bowed down to a standstill watching with,Iambic
deep reverence sky gleamed in bright azure,Iambic
aligning solemnly with beaming sun,Iambic
Approaching twilight slackened its keen steps,Iambic
I wait to hear your footsteps in the hall,Iambic
The night is low and I a wretched beast,Iambic
The pain of empty arms will not relent,Iambic
As I lay down my head to try and rest,Iambic
The violet night winds begin to blow,Iambic
They whisper of the songs you sang to me,Iambic
It silences the torture and the fear,Iambic
That you may not return to me tonight,Iambic
I taste your lips in wine stained tears of love,Iambic
Stinging spray from the sea stung her soft green eyes,Iambic
Looking for something that no longer was there,Iambic
Why do you not come when I call you this night?,Iambic
You promised you'd return if I came to this rock:,Iambic
I was tempted but won over temptation  ,Iambic
I lay my heart at your altar   I am yours,Iambic
As the ocean roared she saw an immense wave,Iambic
And flames issued from its mouth towards the far shore,Iambic
It engulfed her in its arms of desire,Iambic
Holding her secure in its deadly embrace,Iambic
The goddess became as one with the deep sea,Iambic
imprisoned in these rooms and in my mind,Iambic
But inner voices say this cannot be,Iambic
My demons dance around me with their smiles,Iambic
They led me through dark paths for many miles,Iambic
toward this abandoned house to live my days,Iambic
so scattered in the wind of thoughts insane,Iambic
of living in this web with no escape,Iambic
but for the final curtain of death's drape,Iambic
Don't know what's real or just my mind's facade,Iambic
Poetic forms are special tools for me,Iambic
the metric patterns mold words into shape,Iambic
and keep it safe so it will not escape,Iambic
Strong rhyme and meter shape my poetry,Iambic
Iambic forms and quatrains challenge me,Iambic
to make a poem sing within its cage,Iambic
My poems come from music in my soul,Iambic
composing imagery with word control,Iambic

and sculptures do present concentric flows,Iambic
Most paintings show strong balance of design,Iambic
so poetrywith sister artsbestows,Iambic
I never understood just why,Iambic
they banned this charming book     ,Iambic
but that’s just my outlook,Iambic
I never sensed a race bias,Iambic
or that he was not fit,Iambic
to be the hero of this book,Iambic
it only shows his grit,Iambic
so all can read of his courage,Iambic
there on the jungle floor,Iambic
A kitten snuggles on your lap,Iambic
and makes that purring sound,Iambic
Into your soul pours happiness  ,Iambic
and love is all around,Iambic
to keep time with that purr,Iambic
while stroking that soft fur,Iambic
since I have moved out west,Iambic
no more snow was my quest,Iambic
But then I came to realize,Iambic
the beauty of the snow,Iambic
but how was I to know?,Iambic
the winter season through,Iambic
there is a glimpse of blue,Iambic
without that wintry joy,Iambic
your head is screwed on wrong,Iambic
there is more than one song,Iambic
A hundred zillion planets,Iambic
are waiting to be found,Iambic
A billion alien species,Iambic
wait if we look around,Iambic
but life is life is life,Iambic
they also have their strife,Iambic
and get off your high horse,Iambic
You're not the top of the heap,Iambic
there are those with greater force,Iambic
The stars have come to visit earth ,Iambic
but making not a sound,Iambic
you name them as you will,Iambic
while the dark night is still,Iambic
that are beyond your ken,Iambic
Red fire blazing in the wood,Iambic
just charred stumps where trees once stood,Iambic
The denizens must flee and run,Iambic
because the deadly flames have won,Iambic
on slender wire eyed by waiting queue  ,Iambic
So much it seems depends on thin belief  ,Iambic
We flew upon anonymous review                    ,Iambic
Its window panes were dotted with the prints,Iambic
that algid fingers left on hardened glass  ,Iambic
Then wiped away for tourists yet to pass,Iambic
The sight   ineffable to say the least,Iambic
You'd only wish you had more time to feast,Iambic
On blue green ice like paper they were grown  ,Iambic
A hundred shards of crystalline along,Iambic
reflecting cattle herd it lay among,Iambic
No sight but this could make me look away,Iambic
She stood on mountain's edge with dazzled eyes,Iambic
that showed no sign of labour everyday,Iambic
Much to discover on this lovely earth:,Iambic
Discern the way our morning joy unfolds,Iambic
as life awakens with a brand new day ,Iambic
Espy the landscapes that surround us all,Iambic
and note their simple beauty on display,Iambic
Observe the rolling mountains neath her sky,Iambic
perceive their summer green or autumn gold,Iambic
These scenes reveal majestic flowing curves,Iambic
We need to pauseallow earth to disclose,Iambic
how sight of nature's beauty feeds the soul,Iambic
Lead eyes to spot each view that clearly shows,Iambic
her worthdescry these gifts that make us whole,Iambic
their fight is for an ounce of grain,Iambic
but these are tears of other kinds,Iambic
what hope there is it's but to die,Iambic
beyond the reasoning of why,Iambic
The paths We take under the eye of god,Iambic
and know from where our troubled feet have trod,Iambic
made weary from the Roman and his sword,Iambic
and Ireland is the place we chose to be,Iambic
They laid to waste all things we'd ever known,Iambic
and Caeser put us out to where we choose to be,Iambic
here in the only dream to ever last,Iambic
You'll be as much a part of all of me,Iambic
and everything in life we'll ever see,Iambic
it snowed and snowed on the day I was born,Iambic
and for that reason I love falling snow,Iambic
and from my pen the words just drip and flow,Iambic
choosing to read old books and write my words,Iambic
I would wander in nature and be awed,Iambic
loving the songs and beauty of sweet birds,Iambic
then tossed aside as something I enjoyed,Iambic
not thinking there was something else to find,Iambic
I was the man enjoying every quest,Iambic
and loving soon became more than a beat,Iambic
but reaching out was what I couldn't do,Iambic
I will not dim my light so you can shine,Iambic
I will not still my voice so you can scream,Iambic
I will not quench my blaze so you can burn,Iambic
I will not hush my thoughts so you can dream,Iambic
I will not stifle truth so you can preach,Iambic
I will not slink away so you can claim,Iambic
I will not be demure so you can boast,Iambic
I will not bend my head so you can blame,Iambic
I will not hide my thirst so you can drink,Iambic
I will not stave my wants so you can eat,Iambic
I will not stand so you can take my seat,Iambic
Equality is what I’m striving for,Iambic
The days must end when men demand to rule,Iambic
My voice will not be silenced all will hear:,Iambic
She is the beauty of bejeweled night,Iambic
She is the wonder of the dawning day,Iambic
Her wisdom she can temper with her might,Iambic
She is the one to show Compassion's way,Iambic
You do her wrong when you suppress her song,Iambic
When callus hearted mind sees but her form,Iambic
Her virtue is her gentle loving soul,Iambic
Tranquility is she when not the storm,Iambic
I will not be untrue to gendered grace,Iambic
to fit the manly notions of your mind,Iambic
With pride I’ll see you bow to womankind,Iambic
Thick walls that seem to offer no escape,Iambic
Beat unresponsive stone with bloody hands,Iambic
Be still! The prison silence forces you,Iambic
Through which you can emerge in new green lands,Iambic
His thought desire that driving dream he knew,Iambic
so real within his heart and living soul,Iambic
into the part of life that made him whole,Iambic
by doing things that people seldom do,Iambic
If given wings by one who's gone insane,Iambic
and seek more levels where he might immerse,Iambic
bleached on his mind by times eternal curse!,Iambic
he dries in clouds of flowing cosmic dust!,Iambic
no recognition to the ones who'd be,Iambic
and bring him back from where he's flying free!,Iambic
nor find the things that make his feelings void,Iambic
perhaps too busy with their daily grinds,Iambic
and seeking many worlds of other kinds!,Iambic
as puzzles come together and to form,Iambic
that's kept him from a life that's soft and warm!,Iambic
so free of chains that bind him far below,Iambic
far from the one who let it first ascend!,Iambic
has reached the end of his tolerance  His boss is,Iambic
planning to electrocute an elephant for a publicity,Iambic

Inventor?  Him?,Iambic
I'll tell you Edison did not invent,Iambic
the light bulb   that's what he employed me for,Iambic
who'd made a working lamp some years before,Iambic
What is he good at? He's a patent mill!,Iambic

on what they've pulled) The man has got no shame,Iambic
I think he's met his match in Westinghouse,Iambic

A symphony of praise and jubilee,Iambic
Celestial ones with rapture danced and sang,Iambic
And rainbow hues burst forth with joyous glee,Iambic
Your tiny form I cradled to my chest,Iambic
The joy that thrilled our hearts could not be stilled,Iambic
As parents well we knew how we’d been blessed,Iambic
You are the beauty of a starlit night,Iambic
You are the gentle warmth of setting sun,Iambic
You are the wonder of Aurora’s light,Iambic
You know the course you want your life to take,Iambic
You have the will and strength to travel far,Iambic
Speak out and use your voice to leave your mark,Iambic
Let inner light burn bright don’t lose that spark,Iambic

Yet be a fragrant rose of rarest hue,Iambic
Your beauty let the worthy hearted see,Iambic
Don’t be afraid to bloom in colors true,Iambic
Be sure my love will help you find your way,Iambic
The masked intruder burst through my front door,Iambic

They write poems for fun and not for fame ,Iambic
greeting card dribble just isn’t their game,Iambic
but whatever they write they do their best ,Iambic
and the trite expressions some might praise,Iambic
Poems of substance are their best fare ,Iambic
while those written in jest are fun to share,Iambic
and their symbolisms too are usually direct,Iambic
even though some readers prefer them best,Iambic
They can write formal verse or in free style ,Iambic
iambic pentameter too if it makes one smile,Iambic
without resorting to vulgarities for the above,Iambic
but need be neither obscene nor profane,Iambic
it’s the poems they read from which they learn,Iambic
even if scarce others it seems to excite,Iambic
Diverse forms of poetic expression ,Iambic

These eternal florae     of bridal white ,Iambic
And rosy pink immortal in  delight ,Iambic
The diamond leaves  are unfurling now ,Iambic
And pearly mist that glides on wind's showers ,Iambic
One lustrous melody to worship morn ,Iambic
A view of  forever    I'll also see ,Iambic
This holy radiance  spring's lilac tree ,Iambic
You who hunts my dreams when I an awake,Dactyl
Sweep my touches softly from your skin,Dactyl
But know that it will become so thin,Dactyl
And then wave me goodbye,Dactyl
Ill bow mull think am just shy,Dactyl
Until you will see these drops falling in the yellow grass,Dactyl
Have you been in love?,Dactyl
Have you shared a kiss?,Dactyl
Have you ever got a hug?,Dactyl
Have you ever gone thru all of ,Dactyl

Will you not give me your ,Dactyl

We're singing the song of the sleigh ,Dactyl

The Victor,Dactyl
Left someone else to bathe in pride?,Dactyl
Raid the Capitol's treasury?,Dactyl
like Bambi caught in the sights of a hunter's gun,Dactyl
life sometimes ain't any phun,Dactyl
like never gaining permission to be what you want to be,Dactyl
life can often leave you less than feeling free,Dactyl
like the nine to five can often be a burden,Dactyl
life often curses you one to hide behind a curtain,Dactyl
and of all these things i am very certain,Dactyl
like a master with a whip ordering you what to do,Dactyl
life can often seem like a disorganized zoo,Dactyl
like walking through a desert can leave you with an unquenchable thirst,Dactyl
life can make you come in last instead of first,Dactyl
and so one feels thus to be caustically cursed,Dactyl
like so many wasted amens go unheard by the lord,Dactyl
and remorse causes only vengeance and discord,Dactyl
life can often leave one disenchanted and bored,Dactyl
but one must perservere,Dactyl
the way Bambi ambles through the woods with fear,Dactyl
and suffers what he thinks he cannont bear,Dactyl
and so i tell you dear on this paricular day,Dactyl
i must leave you now without an adieu or delay,Dactyl
I left so much behind,Dactyl
That’s what one does when one is losing his or her mind,Dactyl
I left without so much as a final goodbye,Dactyl
That’s what one does when one has an option other than to die,Dactyl
And refuses to listen to one more lascivious lie,Dactyl
To drink him or herself into oblivion,Dactyl
Oblivious to the fact that destiny is dying at his or her bedside,Dactyl
Because fate lied,Dactyl
And forever was an ill conceived concept from the start,Dactyl
Heaved from the heart of heaven and the breath of an angel unseen,Dactyl
But suddenly pragmatic pain replaced the once pristine,Dactyl
And pain is never induced nor seduced to become thus so kind,Dactyl
And that’s why I left so much behind ,Dactyl
Adelaide adored me,Dactyl
Ingrid ignored me,Dactyl
Adelaide and I made quite an odd pair,Dactyl
Yet Ingrid had silver silken threads instead of hair,Dactyl
Looking up to a cloud laden sky I prayed to heaven for Ingrid’s heavenly pleasure,Dactyl
Looking up to a syrupy and sunny sky I begged God that I might discover Ingrid’s,Dactyl
buried treasure,Dactyl
A female fortune sealed in a locker by two silent lips and secreted between two,Dactyl
sultry hips,Dactyl
But in the material that makes up time some fabric often frays while a seam,Dactyl
sometimes rips,Dactyl
And even an expensive faucet drips,Dactyl
With assurance I assign Ingrid as an extravagant and excellent source of radiance,Dactyl
to beheld by me ,Dactyl
And oh to be held by her,Dactyl
To meld with her,Dactyl
As my desire swelled and I swooned to a lady attuned to and beholden to beauty,Dactyl
But as for Adelaide I found her ignorant and distasteful for ignoring and boring me,Dactyl
Whatever she chose to discuss would disgust me with distinguishable diatribes ,Dactyl
sequential and inconsequential subject,Dactyl
If my body is a temple it’s been potently polluted,Dactyl
And if my soul is a church it’s doctrine has been desperately disputed,Dactyl
My head tries to convince me that life can’t get any worse ,Dactyl
Yesterday consistently comes back to inflict me with a bite in my ass,Dactyl
While tomorrow constantly arrives to infect an already festering wound,Dactyl
But my pillow may as well be a sedimentary stone,Dactyl
And still my head and heart won’t leave me alone,Dactyl
While I try in empty desperation to silence a dreadful drone,Dactyl
The sound of my head haunted by a moan,Dactyl
With a heart which heaves a grievous groan,Dactyl
My bedroom is a cell with bars too well known,Dactyl
And hopefulness is drowned out by a tormenting tone,Dactyl
With uncertainty a most horrendous curse,Dactyl
and the gates of tomorrow,Dactyl
And here sit I under a shadow cast by my past and the dissatisfaction of sorrow,Dactyl
While even in silence I can quote sinfulness by chapter and verse,Dactyl
Can we play vets?,Dactyl
Yes Abbie,Dactyl
My Tiger is ill,Dactyl
He swallowed some stones,Dactyl
Yes Abbie ,Dactyl

Love you Abbie ,Dactyl
Love you Nanny,Dactyl
In the heart of the rock,Dactyl
In the depth of the sea,Dactyl
In the room with the lock,Dactyl
At the end of the lea,Dactyl
Is the key to the gate,Dactyl
To the room of your gold,Dactyl
And the knob to your fate ,Dactyl
An event to behold!,Dactyl
I can put things together,Dactyl
Sometimes I'm on what you wear,Dactyl
Sometimes on things,Dactyl
Sometimes I get stuck and you get mad at me,Dactyl
Its not often for me to break ,Dactyl
I'm made out of metal,Dactyl
Six is perfect because its even ,Dactyl
Six is the number of cheeseburges my dad gets at Mcdonalds,Dactyl

Six is like how many words are in orange without them we would noy have orange,Dactyl

and i want you all to know this ,Dactyl
,Dactyl
Life is worth it,Dactyl
When I live for you,Dactyl
It’s how I know that this is love proven true,Dactyl
But there you fly now in the sky,Dactyl
Showing me that differences and flaws,Dactyl
Is coexistence in each other,Dactyl
Celebrate them don’t use them as a weakness,Dactyl
Because in doing that you show weakness in yourself,Dactyl
Show some respect to them ,Dactyl
For they are to be cared for ,Dactyl
Then why is it no one ever does,Dactyl
Do they not see the pain? ,Dactyl
With every dying cuss ,Dactyl
So let the pain engulf me ,Dactyl
Teach my eyes to see,Dactyl
Let a fallen angel come to curse me,Dactyl
Let my cuts come to bleed ,Dactyl
Evil engulfing my broken heart yet falling deep in love ,Dactyl
When everything turns to turmoil ,Dactyl
I turn to my angel from above ,Dactyl
Let my heart come to boil,Dactyl
In the ashes of my innocence ,Dactyl
Letting myself go until I fully reach out to fellow brethren s ,Dactyl
Praying with no feeling I can feel myself slip away,Dactyl
I’m falling yet falling apart ,Dactyl
Without the slightest of delays ,Dactyl
Birth was a mistake and yet I cannot come to die,Dactyl
Was it true that I am meant to live?  ,Dactyl
A man who only knows to cry ,Dactyl
I cannot give,Dactyl
The light has forsaken my cold and darkened heart,Dactyl
For who am I to live ,Dactyl
Cold and fruitless moon why have you forsaken me,Dactyl
Does it bring you joy to see that you are breaking me,Dactyl
Listen to the cold and broken winds ,Dactyl
Nothing can ever beat it,Dactyl
Nor can I defend,Dactyl

In my life till now you have been my one inspire,Dactyl
In my heart I hold this love so open and strong,Dactyl
I have never thought of anyone else all yearlong,Dactyl
When you are far no where near out of touch,Dactyl
At night I've never dreamed of anyone this much,Dactyl
When you're close and I feel your gentle kiss,Dactyl
And when you leave its all of you that I miss,Dactyl
In your heart and soul I will forever confide,Dactyl
Baby in our time together we could never divide,Dactyl
Its your everything that makes my life complete,Dactyl
Its everything we share that makes me heart beat,Dactyl
Baby your name is engraved on my heart,Dactyl
My heart longs for you each time you depart,Dactyl

when will the people who read me pass on the word,Dactyl
tell them to read the genius of a poet you just heard,Dactyl
advise them to sit down and learn from a master of the art,Dactyl
i can sit down and in ten minutes scribe words so  wise,Dactyl
while you all read me with jaundiced eyes,Dactyl
yellow from the disease of not really givIng a damn,Dactyl
when a handfull of poets as talented as me know most of you are a sham,Dactyl
so write about your latest take on betty crocker,Dactyl

She got a boyfriend and I got a whore,Dactyl
She crossed the proverbial street by design,Dactyl
But I crossed the god forsaken line,Dactyl
She did what she did due to a hormone,Dactyl
I did what I did because of testosterone,Dactyl
It was a game of tit for tat and all that,Dactyl
I cursed once more with a tip  o’ my hat,Dactyl
Her only solution was retribution,Dactyl
But I didn’t need her nor her absolution,Dactyl
She was clever but I was mo**er fu**ing brilliant,Dactyl
Women get weary but us men are resilient,Dactyl
What counts is being able to bounce right back,Dactyl
And not  lose what you have and find what you lack,Dactyl
she was no saint  but I was a sinner,Dactyl
And as it turned out there was really no winner,Dactyl

Just for a riband to stick in his coat,Dactyl
Found the one gift of which fortune bereft us,Dactyl
Lost all the others she lets us devote,Dactyl
They with the gold to give doled him out silver,Dactyl
So much was theirs who so little allowed,Dactyl

Was there a man dismayed,Dactyl
Not though the soldier knew,Dactyl
Someone had blundered,Dactyl
Theirs not to make reply,Dactyl
Theirs not to reason why,Dactyl
Theirs but to do and die,Dactyl
Into the valley of Death,Dactyl
Cannon to right of them,Dactyl
Cannon to left of them,Dactyl
Cannon in front of them,Dactyl
Stormed at with shot and shell,Dactyl
Boldly they rode and well,Dactyl
Into the jaws of Death,Dactyl
Into the mouth of hell,Dactyl
Flashed all their sabres bare,Dactyl
Flashed as they turned in air,Dactyl
Sabring the gunners there,Dactyl
Charging an army while,Dactyl
Plunged in the batterysmoke,Dactyl
Right through the line they broke,Dactyl
Cossack and Russian,Dactyl
Reeled from the sabre stroke,Dactyl
Shattered and sundered,Dactyl
Then they rode back but not,Dactyl
Not the six hundredCannon to right of them,Dactyl
Stormed at with shot and shell,Dactyl
While horse and hero fell,Dactyl
They that had fought so well,Dactyl
Back from the mouth of hell,Dactyl
All that was left of them,Dactyl
Left of six hundred,Dactyl
Cannon behind them,Dactyl
Volleyed and thundered,Dactyl
Stormed at with shot and shell,Dactyl
While horse and hero fell,Dactyl
They that had fought so well,Dactyl
Came through the jaws of Death,Dactyl
Back from the mouth of hell,Dactyl
All that was left of them,Dactyl
Left of six hundred,Dactyl

Sometimes the nights are inviting,Dactyl
bringing forth lust that’s exciting,Dactyl
for you are there,Dactyl
Sometimes the days seem made for living,Dactyl
Other times cold and unforgiving,Dactyl
Struggles seem so inconsequential,Dactyl
for you are there,Dactyl
Often as my day unravels,Dactyl
Thinking of you in my travels,Dactyl
I know you care,Dactyl
Sometimes I feel our home’s heaven,Dactyl
for you are there,Dactyl
Once on a gray afternoon I asked o' the bearded ol' miser,Dactyl
Time why so little he gave for the years had been passing me swiftly,Dactyl
Softly then sighing he turned and spoke me these words reprimanding,Dactyl
Youth it is not that I don't give much but that which is given,Dactyl
dies in your care for a day is a seed not to blossom if driven,Dactyl
harsh underfoot If you kill these seeds need I trust in you once more,Dactyl
Truly you squander your time and you let every moment to wither,Dactyl
caring for nothing and doing the same you continue to dither,Dactyl
whereby neglecting to live do you speed down the path to perdition,Dactyl
Nourish those which you have you'll see that I've given you plenty,Dactyl
though ten thousand be granted they cannot compare to just twenty,Dactyl
seeds that take root Go now to your charge and detain me no longer.,Dactyl
Thus did he speak and so left me behind When I looked up ahead I,Dactyl
saw that I'd traveled far but had many more miles to cover,Dactyl
Tyrian sails across stormy seas sailed,Dactyl
and a bold prince they deliver,Dactyl
At every port cheerily he was hailed,Dactyl
as an arrow straight from its quiver,Dactyl
Bade he the pilot to next morn tarry,Dactyl
as he late morn gathered her so true,Dactyl
A pretty queen stolen for he to marry,Dactyl
their dear life in Troy to begin anew,Dactyl
Hoisting ship's tyrian sails and fast away,Dactyl
that morn his mighty ship flew,Dactyl
Blessed they thought that sweet day,Dactyl
our life in Troy together we two,Dactyl
Hearing loving angels sing they wept,Dactyl
hearts united in enchanted glee,Dactyl
Life started a love vow then kept,Dactyl
on to great Troy they both did flee,Dactyl
There by King Priam the son received,Dactyl
far from harm all began rejoicing,Dactyl
Worrying not ire of a Greek king deceived,Dactyl
heedless of dire curses he was voicing,Dactyl
They carried on glowing sweet romance,Dactyl
as vessels carrying a fatal coming doom,Dactyl
About to reap fruits from a daring chance,Dactyl
by ships so packed each had no more room,Dactyl
Vowing and cursing to send Troy to hell,Dactyl
Agamemnon sailed on to Troy's shore,Dactyl
There Homer's storied legend does tell ,Dactyl
how Troy's destruction evens the score,Dactyl
As savage as a king's vengeance may be,Dactyl
there rests a justice in Troy's defeat,Dactyl
For no thief be allowed to safely flee,Dactyl
to enjoy any treasure gained by his cheat,Dactyl
Note No attempt made by me to specifically,Dactyl
copy or dare try to match the majesty and ,Dactyl
splendor of Homer's classic world famous ,Dactyl
tale of the Iliad and the Odyssey,Dactyl
which no man can ever do,Dactyl
The theme was used to present a vastly shorter ,Dactyl
version of death and destruction stealing so,Dactyl
often brings even to innocent peoples,Dactyl
My love for family I do not hide or set high on a wooden shelf,Dactyl
Baubles of life are here having a jot influence over a rime of things,Dactyl
One hawks a sweeter enticement diverting us like a small candy elf,Dactyl
Placed in a closet of my heart it offers now no threat to inner self,Dactyl
Booty that makes us rich seems a bit ornament gaining a shoddy pelf,Dactyl
Family time is togetherness knowing the pleasures it often brings,Dactyl
We talk but nothing unusual like blue and white on ceramic delf,Dactyl
Time for a lady and children as husbands sit talking as royal kings,Dactyl
