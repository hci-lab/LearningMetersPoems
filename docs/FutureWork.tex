\section{Future Work}
In this paper, we introduced several ways and methods  to classify Arabic and English Poems. We provide some methods and techniques to work with such problem based on the character level and analyze the text concerning musical way. Also, we have published our datasets to be open source for the community to encourage the community of research into Artifical intelligence to continue from our original works here. We believe the problem and our datasets can be used in the below future works.

\begin{itemize}
\item Enhance the classification results to be same as the human expert.
\item Use the current datasets to classify the poem meaning as this paper did not work for this idea. %based on the Alabyaat type mad7 or 3`azal
\item Analyze the historical impact based on the Poem and the Poetry for example for a specific period Is the Poem affected by this period, or there are patterns of writing between the Poetry or not.
\item Can we generate from each class some poem similar to the poetry poems?
\end{itemize}
