                  input. A coded transcription of the poetry pattern forms is produced from input
                  processing. The system identi?es and distinguishes between proper spoken poetic
                  meter and improper poetic meter. Error in the poem meters (Bahr, Buhur) and the
                  ending rhyme pattern, "Qa?ya" are detected and veri?ed. The system accepts user
                  selection of a desired poem meter and then interactively aids the user in the
                  composition of poetry in the selected meter, suggesting alter native Words and

  year =	 {2009},
  abstract =	 {Arabic poetry is a form of metrical speech with a rhyme. The rhyme in Arabic
                  poetry is achieved by every line of the poem ending upon a specific tone. Rhymes
                  may vary. The discipline that studies rhymes and rhythms is Prosody, the rules of
                  which were spelt out by the Basri linguist, Al-Khalil Bin Ahmed
                  Al-Farahidi. Prosody is a thorny and complex discipline due to the overlap of the
                  rules by which it is possible to analyze and recognize poetry meters and
                  rhythms. So many specialized publications tried to facilitate learning prosody by
                  establishing rules or arranging tables to explain its principles and. One of these
                  attempts is the study by Dr. Mohammad Tarik El-Katib which converts a line of
                  poetry into binary bits and then gives its equivalent decimal codes. He summarized
                  his effort in a set of tables that must be referred to when identifying the meter
                  to which a poetical line conforms. The current research aims at computerizing
                  El-Katib's method identifies the meter of a line of poetry, revealing its
                  linguistic components, and choosing the correct places for post placement which
                  gives the line its special musical ring. The system was applied to many examples
                  of standard Arabic poetry whether old or modern. It has proved to be successful in
                  identifying the poetical feet which are the verbal measures that decide the
                  poetical meter and its distinctive rhythm in the long run. The system is
                  educational. Its features and capabilities help both teachers and students to
                  understand prosody.},
