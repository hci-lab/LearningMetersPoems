The . Abstract In this paper , we make a program that can find the poem meter name (called Bahar in Arabic) by Arud science , this science provides a methodology to classify Arabic poems into 16 meters , to help a user to find the meter name for any Arabic poem using context free grammar (CFG) . And we discuss the solutions for problems , from the starting phase to the result , using regular expression and CFG . And the result 75{\%} of the verse is found its meter , when input enters correctly .},

abstract = {Arabic poetry is a form of metrical speech with a rhyme. The rhyme in Arabic poetry is achieved by every line of the poem ending upon a specific tone. Rhymes may vary. The discipline that studies rhymes and rhythms is Prosody, the rules of which were spelt out by the Basri linguist, Al-Khalil Bin Ahmed Al-Farahidi. Prosody is a thorny and complex discipline due to the overlap of the rules by which it is possible to analyze and recognize poetry meters and rhythms. So many specialized publications tried to facilitate learning prosody by establishing rules or arranging tables to explain its principles and. One of these attempts is the study by Dr. Mohammad Tarik El-Katib which converts a line of poetry into binary bits and then gives its equivalent decimal codes. He summarized his effort in a set of tables that must be referred to when identifying the meter to which a poetical line conforms. The current research aims at computerizing El-Katib's method identifies the meter of a line of poetry, revealing its linguistic components, and choosing the correct places for post placement which gives the line its special musical ring. The system was applied to many examples of standard Arabic poetry whether old or modern. It has proved to be successful in identifying the poetical feet which are the verbal measures that decide the poetical meter and its distinctive rhythm in the long run. The system is educational. Its features and capabilities help both teachers and students to understand prosody.},

abstract = {We propose a machine learning method for recognizing modern Arabic poems based on the common poetic features of modern Arabic poetry. The poetic features include: rhyming, repetition, use of diacritics and punctuations, and text alignment. The method can classify text documents as poem or non-poem documents with a very high accuracy of 99.81{\%}.},

@article{Kurt2012,
abstract = {Non-STEM; Diwan poetry is an important branch of classical Turkish literature (or Ottoman literature) that uses arud meter (wazn AR1 or bahr AR, {\"{o}}l{\c{c}}{\"{u}} TR2). The teaching of classical poetry in high schools and in literature departments in universities requires an understanding of this meter. Arud is also used in Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and other eastern languages. Determining the arud meter of poems written in the Ottoman language (Osmanlica TR) is a difficult and tedious task for those who study poetry. In this paper, we focus on the computerized analysis of arud meter. We present an algorithm that is able to determine the correct arud meter for a given poem and is also able to point out the anomalies or flaws in poems with respect to arud. The preliminary tests are quite satisfactory and the algorithm that we developed yields a very high accuracy. This project3 is available as a web-based application that includes a small Diwan poetry database and an algorithm for determining the syllabic meter (hece {\"{o}}l{\c{c}}{\"{u}}s{\"{u}} TR) of poems in Turkish folk literature. The application can be used as a teaching aid for teachers of classical poetry and as a research tool for scholars and professionals studying poetry. {\textcopyright} T{\"{U}}BITAK.},
