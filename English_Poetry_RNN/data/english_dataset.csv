641,by heavens for such a man in his youthful prime,pyrrhic
642,there was none dirtier whose home had more grime,pyrrhic
643,the constant reek of gunge what better invitation,pyrrhic
644,to every pest flying or crawling for cohabitation,pyrrhic
645,hed hoped to kill the poverty that to him had seemed to glue,pyrrhic
646,with the job for which hed been invited for an interview,pyrrhic
647,alas his file jacket was barely held by its leather threads,pyrrhic
648,and his results and certificates partly eaten were in shreds,pyrrhic
649,enough hed thought and bought a mousetrap,pyrrhic
650,with smoked fish bait hed soon heard the traps first clap,pyrrhic
651,of the fathers mothers and offsprings hed caught one,pyrrhic
652,with this and others after hed planned his vengeful fun,pyrrhic
653,with glee to the street hed stepped with the vermin,pyrrhic
654,the fate of which only he could now determine,pyrrhic
655,hed doused it with petrol amidst street kids cheers,pyrrhic
656,but oblivious of his folly and fates inaudible jeers,pyrrhic
657,with a single match strike it was engulfed in flames,pyrrhic
658,and what happened next he had none to apportion blames,pyrrhic
659,for in blind anguish the rat had dashed back into his room,pyrrhic
660,the house had charred smoking with a mile high plume,pyrrhic
661,you were an afghan farid khan by name,pyrrhic
662,a name less known to the world today,pyrrhic
663,you ran away from home,pyrrhic
664,because your own stepmother plotted against you,pyrrhic
665,now you were runawaykhan,pyrrhic
666,you chose to be a knighterrant,pyrrhic
667,soon became a military commander in bihar,pyrrhic
668,was renamed sher khan a title awarded,pyrrhic
669,by the governor of bihar,pyrrhic
670,whom you saved from the jaws of a tiger,pyrrhic
671,so you became the deputy governor,pyrrhic
672,but wherever you went,pyrrhic
673,your ruler feared your strength and potential,pyrrhic
674,and of course you were in trouble,pyrrhic
675,for instance during your stint,pyrrhic
676,in baburs army you easily caught,pyrrhic
677,the moghul ruler attention,pyrrhic
678,who promptly exhorted one of his ministers,pyrrhic
679,keep an eye on this young man,pyrrhic
680,he is clever,pyrrhic
681,and i see royal marks on his forehead,pyrrhic
682,you were shrewd enough,pyrrhic
683,to sense the great kings fear and suspicion,pyrrhic
684,you quit his army soon,pyrrhic
685,during your stint however,pyrrhic
686,you were sharp enough to notice,pyrrhic
687,the weakness in the moghul system,pyrrhic
688,the rulers overdependence on his ministers,pyrrhic
689,i will not you told yourself,pyrrhic
690,make the mistake when i become a ruler,pyrrhic
691,when humayun baburs son ascended the throne,pyrrhic
692,after his fathers death you saw,pyrrhic
693,the chance of a lifetime,pyrrhic
694,you inflicted a crushing defeat,pyrrhic
695,on him in the battle of chausa in,pyrrhic
696,became sher shah the emperor,pyrrhic
697,from farid khan to sher shah,pyrrhic
698,an amazing trajectory,pyrrhic
699,comparable to napoleons,pyrrhic
700,you are acknowledged even today as a brilliant strategist,pyrrhic
701,a gifted administrator and a capable general,pyrrhic
702,your whole life is indeed an object lesson,pyrrhic
703,in strategy diplomacy and administration,pyrrhic
704,india post in the s honoured you,pyrrhic
705,by issuing a postal stamp,pyrrhic
706,you were by and large a role model for the later moghul,pyrrhic
707,king akbar the great,pyrrhic
708,and at the same time a standing warning to him,pyrrhic
709,dont collide headon with the rajputs,pyrrhic
710,the fine warrior race of rajasthan,pyrrhic
711,akbar befriended them,pyrrhic
712,and had the best of both worlds,pyrrhic
713,but emperor aurangazeb,pyrrhic
714,though he came much later,pyrrhic
715,was too obtuse to follow this lesson,pyrrhic
716,well you chose to take on the rajputs,pyrrhic
717,and not surprisingly got into trouble,pyrrhic
718,your earlier victory,pyrrhic
719,over the rajput king maldeo of marwar,pyrrhic
720,you achieved by causing dissension between the king,pyrrhic
721,and his able generals by forging letters,pyrrhic
722,which were as you rightly expected intercepted,pyrrhic
723,maldeo left the battle field disgusted,pyrrhic
724,you won,pyrrhic
725,this strategy is known as mitrabheda,pyrrhic
726,as spelt out in panchatantra,pyrrhic
727,and you knew it by instinct,pyrrhic
728,all is fair in love and war,pyrrhic
729,anyway yours was after all a pyrrhic victory,pyrrhic
730,considering your losses,pyrrhic
731,which you yourself highly regretted,pyrrhic
732,much earlier in your career however,pyrrhic
733,you practised a different strategy known as mitralabha,pyrrhic
734,securing that is friends and allies,pyrrhic
735,you formed an alliance with ujjaini rajputs in bihar,pyrrhic
736,and so were able to defeat the mighty sultan of bengal,pyrrhic
737,but later in your life you ignored,pyrrhic
738,this strategyat your peril,pyrrhic
739,the crows in panchatantra were able,pyrrhic
740,to defeat the clever owls,pyrrhic
741,because of the sane counsel,pyrrhic
742,they had from chiranjeevin the wise crow,pyrrhic
743,thats what the whole book,pyrrhic
744,of kakolukiyam of panchtantra is about,pyrrhic
745,but you shunned counsellors,pyrrhic
746,presumably because of the lesson,pyrrhic
747,that you had learnt earlier from the moghuls,pyrrhic
748,so you lost your own life labdhapranasam,pyrrhic
749,you resorted to aparikhitakaraka illconsidered action,pyrrhic
750,which panchantra urges us to avoid,pyrrhic
751,in the year in the battle of kalinjar,pyrrhic
752,for a small cause,pyrrhic
753,you besieged the historic rajput fort,pyrrhic
754,all your tactics failed,pyrrhic
755,then you took a drastic step,pyrrhic
756,you decided to blow up,pyrrhic
757,the strong fort with gunpowder,pyrrhic
758,you yourself were blown up,pyrrhic
759,oh such a spring in sixtythree,pyrrhic
760,the orchard there for miles theyd see,pyrrhic
761,light shades of pink that tinged the clouds,pyrrhic
762,on blossoms where the bees would crowd,pyrrhic
763,and dance from tree to tree,pyrrhic
764,the sun splashed yellow all around,pyrrhic
765,young lovers kissed outside the town,pyrrhic
766,beneath the copse of trees,pyrrhic
767,the rumble of a summer storm,pyrrhic
768,disguised the din of truth forlorn,pyrrhic
769,as thousands marched this summer day,pyrrhic
770,our nations sons in blue and gray,pyrrhic
771,like bees of spring they swarmed,pyrrhic
772,but not for life and not for play,pyrrhic
773,instead a pyrrhic death ballet,pyrrhic
774,the worst that man performs,pyrrhic
775,the orchard where they struck was shattered,pyrrhic
776,both limb of man and tree were scattered,pyrrhic
777,the rubble of their hate was strewn,pyrrhic
778,where once a fruit of peace was grown,pyrrhic
779,blood and life was splattered,pyrrhic
780,but in these fields a seed was sewn,pyrrhic
781,and grows to bear a truth thats known,pyrrhic
782,nourishing what matters,pyrrhic
783,the tears that drip like autumn leaves,pyrrhic
784,shed for the dead and those they freed,pyrrhic
785,are buried by first winters fall,pyrrhic
786,and mourned by coyotes lonely call,pyrrhic
787,now joined by mothers pleas,pyrrhic
788,while there a girl with tattered shawl,pyrrhic
789,sobs for her love lost in the brawl,pyrrhic
790,beneath the copse of trees,pyrrhic
791,on a dark and stormy,pyrrhic
792,night in salem,pyrrhic
793,into the beanery,pyrrhic
794,they stalk,pyrrhic
795,like heroes of,pyrrhic
796,the trojan war,pyrrhic
797,in gravid stillness,pyrrhic
798,they sit,pyrrhic
799,calm polite,pyrrhic
800,proper distant,pyrrhic
801,who is dreaming,pyrrhic
802,whom today i wonder,pyrrhic
803,they read aloud about the theater,pyrrhic
804,a ritual only death can halt,pyrrhic
805,if death has the temerity to try,pyrrhic
806,arrows of contention are caught,pyrrhic
807,deftly on thick shields,pyrrhic
808,the thrust and parry,pyrrhic
809,of old soldiers,pyrrhic
810,is a joy to see,pyrrhic
811,then out of nowhere he says,pyrrhic
812,mitera ive had enough,pyrrhic
813,of this you win,pyrrhic
814,tears channel her arctic cheeks,pyrrhic
815,she says how dare you catapult,pyrrhic

821,a fig in hummus he says,pyrrhic
822,my wooden horse has burned,pyrrhic
823,my crews sailed away,pyrrhic
824,to join old wives,pyrrhic
825,this wars gone on,pyrrhic
826,for too long mitera,pyrrhic
827,she interrupts,pyrrhic
828,this isnt war uhl,pyrrhic

835,agreement we signed,pyrrhic
836,in blood uhl she cries,pyrrhic

852,with helmet dented by,pyrrhic
853,recriminations,pyrrhic
854,he hobbles to the door,pyrrhic
855,pausing to breathe in,pyrrhic
856,the night refulgent,pyrrhic
857,with the reek of romance,pyrrhic
858,his liquid voice finds,pyrrhic
859,her burning ears,pyrrhic
860,for the last time,pyrrhic
861,he borrows from the great,pyrrhic
862,turnip nose himself,pyrrhic

884,so high above the level of your head,pyrrhic
885,do not ask him for too many favors,pyrrhic
886,do not stir up old quarrels,pyrrhic
887,never should you reflect upon the past bone of contention,pyrrhic

890,and his cohorts,pyrrhic
891,do not eat hastily,pyrrhic

896,do not stand or leave the presence of the king,pyrrhic
897,with crumpled shirts or an unkempt bowtie,pyrrhic
898,many lives have been lost before you gained acceptance,pyrrhic
899,and recognition to stay in that glamorous palace,pyrrhic
900,it sounds though like pyrrhic victory in my ears,pyrrhic
901,our gains do not outweigh our losses,pyrrhic
902,may we sing the glad song of moses,pyrrhic

906,whence there came a pawn the hushed crowded movie house,pyrrhic
907,a phantom of horror sprung out of the rookery that wrought deadly havoc,pyrrhic
908,renting asunder innocent audience members,pyrrhic
909,anticipating batman annihilate evil within manichean eternal duel,pyrrhic
910,extant within imaginary world of gotham portrayed on the silver screen,pyrrhic
911,when out of the black curtained theater tear gas canisters got hurled pell mell,pyrrhic
912,accompanied by a fusillade of heavy machine gun fire,pyrrhic
913,sheering many lives,pyrrhic
914,many in the prime ascent sans parabola of adulthood,pyrrhic
915,the youngest a sixyearold girl transformed into an ashen colored corpse,pyrrhic
916,which death yet revealed to her young mother,pyrrhic
917,critically wounded and clamoring for said daughter,pyrrhic

2244,to eat the worlds due by the grave and thee,iambic
2245,when forty winters shall beseige thy brow,iambic
2246,and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field,iambic
2247,thy youths proud livery so gazed on now,iambic
2248,will be a tatterd weed of small worth held,iambic
2249,then being askd where all thy beauty lies,iambic
2250,where all the treasure of thy lusty days,iambic
2251,to say within thine own deepsunken eyes,iambic
2252,were an alleating shame and thriftless praise,iambic
2253,how much more praise deserved thy beautys use,iambic
2254,if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine,iambic
2255,shall sum my count and make my old excuse,iambic
2256,proving his beauty by succession thine,iambic
2257,this were to be new made when thou art old,iambic
2258,and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold,iambic
2259,look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,iambic
2260,now is the time that face should form another,iambic
2261,whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,iambic
2262,thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother,iambic
2263,for where is she so fair whose uneard womb,iambic
2264,disdains the tillage of thy husbandry,iambic
2265,or who is he so fond will be the tomb,iambic
2266,of his selflove to stop posterity,iambic
2267,thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee,iambic
2268,calls back the lovely april of her prime,iambic
2269,so thou through windows of thine age shall see,iambic
2270,despite of wrinkles this thy golden time,iambic
2271,but if thou live rememberd not to be,iambic
2272,die single and thine image dies with thee,iambic
2273,unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,iambic
2274,upon thyself thy beautys legacy,iambic
2275,natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend,iambic
2276,and being frank she lends to those are free,iambic
2277,then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,iambic
2278,the bounteous largess given thee to give,iambic
2279,profitless usurer why dost thou use,iambic
2280,so great a sum of sums yet canst not live,iambic
2281,for having traffic with thyself alone,iambic
2282,thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,iambic
2283,then how when nature calls thee to be gone,iambic
2284,what acceptable audit canst thou leave,iambic
2285,thy unused beauty must be tombd with thee,iambic
2286,which used lives th executor to be,iambic
2287,those hours that with gentle work did frame,iambic
2288,the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,iambic
2289,will play the tyrants to the very same,iambic
2290,and that unfair which fairly doth excel,iambic
2291,for neverresting time leads summer on,iambic
2292,to hideous winter and confounds him there,iambic
2293,sap chequed with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,iambic
2294,beauty oersnowd and bareness every where,iambic
2295,then were not summers distillation left,iambic
2296,a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,iambic
2297,beautys effect with beauty were bereft,iambic
2298,nor it nor no remembrance what it was,iambic
2299,but flowers distilld though they with winter meet,iambic
2300,leese but their show their substance still lives sweet,iambic
2301,then let not winters ragged hand deface,iambic
2302,in thee thy summer ere thou be distilld,iambic
2303,make sweet some vial treasure thou some place,iambic
2304,with beautys treasure ere it be selfkilld,iambic
2305,that use is not forbidden usury,iambic
2306,which happies those that pay the willing loan,iambic
2307,thats for thyself to breed another thee,iambic
2308,or ten times happier be it ten for one,iambic
2309,ten times thyself were happier than thou art,iambic
2310,if ten of thine ten times refigured thee,iambic
2311,then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,iambic
2312,leaving thee living in posterity,iambic
2313,be not selfwilld for thou art much too fair,iambic
2314,to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir,iambic
2315,lo in the orient when the gracious light,iambic
2316,lifts up his burning head each under eye,iambic
2317,doth homage to his newappearing sight,iambic
2318,serving with looks his sacred majesty,iambic
2319,and having climbd the steepup heavenly hill,iambic
2320,resembling strong youth in his middle age,iambic
2321,yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,iambic
2322,attending on his golden pilgrimage,iambic
2323,but when from highmost pitch with weary car,iambic
2324,like feeble age he reeleth from the day,iambic
2325,the eyes fore duteous now converted are,iambic
2326,from his low tract and look another way,iambic
2327,so thou thyself outgoing in thy noon,iambic
2328,unlookd on diest unless thou get a son,iambic
2329,music to hear why hearst thou music sadly,iambic
2330,sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy,iambic
2331,why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,iambic
2332,or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy,iambic
2333,if the true concord of welltuned sounds,iambic
2334,by unions married do offend thine ear,iambic
2335,they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds,iambic
2336,in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear,iambic
2337,mark how one string sweet husband to another,iambic
2338,strikes each in each by mutual ordering,iambic
2339,resembling sire and child and happy mother,iambic
2340,who all in one one pleasing note do sing,iambic
2341,whose speechless song being many seeming one,iambic
2342,sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none,iambic
2343,is it for fear to wet a widows eye,iambic
2344,that thou consumest thyself in single life,iambic
2345,ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die,iambic
2346,the world will wail thee like a makeless wife,iambic
2347,the world will be thy widow and still weep,iambic
2348,that thou no form of thee hast left behind,iambic
2349,when every private widow well may keep,iambic
2350,by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind,iambic
2351,look what an unthrift in the world doth spend,iambic
2352,shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it,iambic
2353,but beautys waste hath in the world an end,iambic
2354,and kept unused the user so destroys it,iambic
2355,no love toward others in that bosom sits,iambic
2356,that on himself such murderous shame commits,iambic
2357,for shame deny that thou bearst love to any,iambic
2358,who for thyself art so unprovident,iambic
2359,grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many,iambic
2360,but that thou none lovest is most evident,iambic
2361,for thou art so possessd with murderous hate,iambic
2362,that gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire,iambic
2363,seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate,iambic
2364,which to repair should be thy chief desire,iambic
2365,o change thy thought that i may change my mind,iambic
2366,shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love,iambic
2367,be as thy presence is gracious and kind,iambic
2368,or to thyself at least kindhearted prove,iambic
2369,make thee another self for love of me,iambic
2370,that beauty still may live in thine or thee,iambic
2371,as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest,iambic
2372,in one of thine from that which thou departest,iambic
2373,and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest,iambic
2374,thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,iambic
2375,herein lives wisdom beauty and increase,iambic
2376,without this folly age and cold decay,iambic
2377,if all were minded so the times should cease,iambic
2378,and threescore year would make the world away,iambic
2379,let those whom nature hath not made for store,iambic
2380,harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish,iambic
2381,look whom she best endowd she gave the more,iambic
2382,which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish,iambic
2383,she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby,iambic
2384,thou shouldst print more not let that copy die,iambic
2385,when i do count the clock that tells the time,iambic
2386,and see the brave day sunk in hideous night,iambic
2387,when i behold the violet past prime,iambic
2388,and sable curls all silverd oer with white,iambic
2389,when lofty trees i see barren of leaves,iambic
2390,which erst from heat did canopy the herd,iambic
2391,and summers green all girded up in sheaves,iambic
2392,borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,iambic
2393,then of thy beauty do i question make,iambic
2394,that thou among the wastes of time must go,iambic
2395,since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,iambic
2396,and die as fast as they see others grow,iambic
2397,and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence,iambic
2398,save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence,iambic
2399,o that you were yourself but love you are,iambic
2400,no longer yours than you yourself here live,iambic
2401,against this coming end you should prepare,iambic
2402,and your sweet semblance to some other give,iambic
2403,so should that beauty which you hold in lease,iambic
2404,find no determination then you were,iambic
2405,yourself again after yourselfs decease,iambic
2406,when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear,iambic
2407,who lets so fair a house fall to decay,iambic
2408,which husbandry in honour might uphold,iambic
2409,against the stormy gusts of winters day,iambic
2410,and barren rage of deaths eternal cold,iambic
2411,o none but unthrifts dear my love you know,iambic
2412,you had a father let your son say so,iambic
2413,not from the stars do i my judgment pluck,iambic
2414,and yet methinks i have astronomy,iambic
2415,but not to tell of good or evil luck,iambic
2416,of plagues of dearths or seasons quality,iambic
2417,nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell,iambic
2418,pointing to each his thunder rain and wind,iambic
2419,or say with princes if it shall go well,iambic
2420,by oft predict that i in heaven find,iambic
2421,but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive,iambic
2422,and constant stars in them i read such art,iambic
2423,as truth and beauty shall together thrive,iambic
2424,if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert,iambic
2425,or else of thee this i prognosticate,iambic
2426,thy end is truths and beautys doom and date,iambic
2427,when i consider every thing that grows,iambic
2428,holds in perfection but a little moment,iambic
2429,that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows,iambic
2430,whereon the stars in secret influence comment,iambic
2431,when i perceive that men as plants increase,iambic
2432,cheered and chequed even by the selfsame sky,iambic
2433,vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease,iambic
2434,and wear their brave state out of memory,iambic
2435,then the conceit of this inconstant stay,iambic
2436,sets you most rich in youth before my sight,iambic
2437,where wasteful time debateth with decay,iambic
2438,to change your day of youth to sullied night,iambic
2439,and all in war with time for love of you,iambic
2440,as he takes from you i engraft you new,iambic
2441,but wherefore do not you a mightier way,iambic
2442,make war upon this bloody tyrant time,iambic
2443,and fortify yourself in your decay,iambic
2444,with means more blessed than my barren rhyme,iambic
2445,now stand you on the top of happy hours,iambic
2446,and many maiden gardens yet unset,iambic
2447,with virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,iambic
2448,much liker than your painted counterfeit,iambic
2449,so should the lines of life that life repair,iambic
2450,which this times pencil or my pupil pen,iambic
2451,neither in inward worth nor outward fair,iambic
2452,can make you live yourself in eyes of men,iambic
2453,to give away yourself keeps yourself still,iambic
2454,and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill,iambic
2455,who will believe my verse in time to come,iambic
2456,if it were filld with your most high deserts,iambic
2457,though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb,iambic
2458,which hides your life and shows not half your parts,iambic
2459,if i could write the beauty of your eyes,iambic
2460,and in fresh numbers number all your graces,iambic
2461,the age to come would say this poet lies,iambic
2462,such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces,iambic
2463,so should my papers yellowd with their age,iambic
2464,be scornd like old men of less truth than tongue,iambic
2465,and your true rights be termd a poets rage,iambic
2466,and stretched metre of an antique song,iambic
2467,but were some child of yours alive that time,iambic
2468,you should live twice in it and in my rhyme,iambic
2469,shall i compare thee to a summers day,iambic
2470,thou art more lovely and more temperate,iambic
2471,rough winds do shake the darling buds of may,iambic
2472,and summers lease hath all too short a date,iambic
2473,sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,iambic
2474,and often is his gold complexion dimmd,iambic
2475,and every fair from fair sometime declines,iambic
2476,by chance or natures changing course untrimmd,iambic
2477,but thy eternal summer shall not fade,iambic
2478,nor lose possession of that fair thou owest,iambic
2479,nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade,iambic
2480,when in eternal lines to time thou growest,iambic
2481,so long as men can breathe or eyes can see,iambic
2482,so long lives this and this gives life to thee,iambic
2483,devouring time blunt thou the lions paws,iambic
2484,and make the earth devour her own sweet brood,iambic
2485,pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws,iambic
2486,and burn the longlived phoenix in her blood,iambic
2487,make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,iambic
2488,and do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted time,iambic
2489,to the wide world and all her fading sweets,iambic
2490,but i forbid thee one most heinous crime,iambic
2491,o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow,iambic
2492,nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,iambic
2493,him in thy course untainted do allow,iambic
2494,for beautys pattern to succeeding men,iambic
2495,yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong,iambic
2496,my love shall in my verse ever live young,iambic
2497,a womans face with natures own hand painted,iambic
2498,hast thou the mastermistress of my passion,iambic
2499,a womans gentle heart but not acquainted,iambic
2500,with shifting change as is false womens fashion,iambic
2501,an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling,iambic
2502,gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,iambic
2503,a man in hue all hues in his controlling,iambic
2504,much steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth,iambic
2505,and for a woman wert thou first created,iambic
2506,till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting,iambic
2507,and by addition me of thee defeated,iambic
2508,by adding one thing to my purpose nothing,iambic
2509,but since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure,iambic
2510,mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure,iambic
2511,so is it not with me as with that muse,iambic
2512,stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse,iambic
2513,who heaven itself for ornament doth use,iambic
2514,and every fair with his fair doth rehearse,iambic
2515,making a couplement of proud compare,iambic
2516,with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems,iambic
2517,with aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare,iambic
2518,that heavens air in this huge rondure hems,iambic
2519,o let me true in love but truly write,iambic
2520,and then believe me my love is as fair,iambic
2521,as any mothers child though not so bright,iambic
2522,as those gold candles fixd in heavens air,iambic
2523,let them say more than like of hearsay well,iambic
2524,i will not praise that purpose not to sell,iambic
2525,my glass shall not persuade me i am old,iambic
2526,so long as youth and thou are of one date,iambic
2527,but when in thee times furrows i behold,iambic
2528,then look i death my days should expiate,iambic
2529,for all that beauty that doth cover thee,iambic
2530,is but the seemly raiment of my heart,iambic
2531,which in thy breast doth live as thine in me,iambic
2532,how can i then be elder than thou art,iambic
2533,o therefore love be of thyself so wary,iambic
2534,as i not for myself but for thee will,iambic
2535,bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary,iambic
2536,as tender nurse her babe from faring ill,iambic
2537,presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,iambic
2538,thou gavest me thine not to give back again,iambic
2539,as an unperfect actor on the stage,iambic
2540,who with his fear is put besides his part,iambic
2541,or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,iambic
2542,whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart,iambic
2543,so i for fear of trust forget to say,iambic
2544,the perfect ceremony of loves rite,iambic
2545,and in mine own loves strength seem to decay,iambic
2546,oercharged with burden of mine own loves might,iambic
2547,o let my books be then the eloquence,iambic
2548,and dumb presagers of my speaking breast,iambic
2549,who plead for love and look for recompense,iambic
2550,more than that tongue that more hath more expressd,iambic
2551,o learn to read what silent love hath writ,iambic
2552,to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit,iambic
2553,mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld,iambic
2554,thy beautys form in table of my heart,iambic
2555,my body is the frame wherein tis held,iambic
2556,and perspective it is the painters art,iambic
2557,for through the painter must you see his skill,iambic
2558,to find where your true image pictured lies,iambic
2559,which in my bosoms shop is hanging still,iambic
2560,that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes,iambic
2561,now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,iambic
2562,mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me,iambic
2563,are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun,iambic
2564,delights to peep to gaze therein on thee,iambic
2565,yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,iambic
2566,they draw but what they see know not the heart,iambic
2567,let those who are in favour with their stars,iambic
2568,of public honour and proud titles boast,iambic
2569,whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars,iambic
2570,unlookd for joy in that i honour most,iambic
2571,great princes favourites their fair leaves spread,iambic
2572,but as the marigold at the suns eye,iambic
2573,and in themselves their pride lies buried,iambic
2574,for at a frown they in their glory die,iambic
2575,the painful warrior famoused for fight,iambic
2576,after a thousand victories once foild,iambic
2577,is from the book of honour razed quite,iambic
2578,and all the rest forgot for which he toild,iambic
2579,then happy i that love and am beloved,iambic
2580,where i may not remove nor be removed,iambic
2581,lord of my love to whom in vassalage,iambic
2582,thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,iambic
2583,to thee i send this written embassage,iambic
2584,to witness duty not to show my wit,iambic
2585,duty so great which wit so poor as mine,iambic
2586,may make seem bare in wanting words to show it,iambic
2587,but that i hope some good conceit of thine,iambic
2588,in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it,iambic
2589,till whatsoever star that guides my moving,iambic
2590,points on me graciously with fair aspect,iambic
2591,and puts apparel on my tatterd loving,iambic
2592,to show me worthy of thy sweet respect,iambic
2593,then may i dare to boast how i do love thee,iambic
2594,till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me,iambic
2595,weary with toil i haste me to my bed,iambic
2596,the dear repose for limbs with travel tired,iambic
2597,but then begins a journey in my head,iambic
2598,to work my mind when bodys works expired,iambic
2599,for then my thoughts from far where i abide,iambic
2600,intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,iambic
2601,and keep my drooping eyelids open wide,iambic
2602,looking on darkness which the blind do see,iambic
2603,save that my souls imaginary sight,iambic
2604,presents thy shadow to my sightless view,iambic
2605,which like a jewel hung in ghastly night,iambic
2606,makes black night beauteous and her old face new,iambic
2607,lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind,iambic
2608,for thee and for myself no quiet find,iambic
2609,how can i then return in happy plight,iambic
2610,that am debarrd the benefit of rest,iambic
2611,when days oppression is not eased by night,iambic
2612,but day by night and night by day oppressd,iambic
2613,and each though enemies to eithers reign,iambic
2614,do in consent shake hands to torture me,iambic
2615,the one by toil the other to complain,iambic
2616,how far i toil still farther off from thee,iambic
2617,i tell the day to please them thou art bright,iambic
2618,and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven,iambic
2619,so flatter i the swartcomplexiond night,iambic
2620,when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even,iambic
2621,but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,iambic
2622,and night doth nightly make griefs strength,iambic
2623,when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes,iambic
2624,i all alone beweep my outcast state,iambic
2625,and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,iambic
2626,and look upon myself and curse my fate,iambic
2627,wishing me like to one more rich in hope,iambic
2628,featured like him like him with friends possessd,iambic
2629,desiring this mans art and that mans scope,iambic
2630,with what i most enjoy contented least,iambic
2631,yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,iambic
2632,haply i think on thee and then my state,iambic
2633,like to the lark at break of day arising,iambic
2634,from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate,iambic
2635,for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings,iambic
2636,that then i scorn to change my state with kings,iambic
2637,when to the sessions of sweet silent thought,iambic
2638,i summon up remembrance of things past,iambic
2639,i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought,iambic
2640,and with old woes new wail my dear times waste,iambic
2641,then can i drown an eye unused to flow,iambic
2642,for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night,iambic
2643,and weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe,iambic
2644,and moan the expense of many a vanishd sight,iambic
2645,then can i grieve at grievances foregone,iambic
2646,and heavily from woe to woe tell oer,iambic
2647,the sad account of forebemoaned moan,iambic
2648,which i new pay as if not paid before,iambic
2649,but if the while i think on thee dear friend,iambic
2650,all losses are restored and sorrows end,iambic
2651,thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,iambic
2652,which i by lacking have supposed dead,iambic
2653,and there reigns love and all loves loving parts,iambic
2654,and all those friends which i thought buried,iambic
2655,how many a holy and obsequious tear,iambic
2656,hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye,iambic
2657,as interest of the dead which now appear,iambic
2658,but things removed that hidden in thee lie,iambic
2659,thou art the grave where buried love doth live,iambic
2660,hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,iambic
2661,who all their parts of me to thee did give,iambic
2662,that due of many now is thine alone,iambic
2663,their images i loved i view in thee,iambic
2664,and thou all they hast all the all of me,iambic
2665,if thou survive my wellcontented day,iambic
2666,when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover,iambic
2667,and shalt by fortune once more resurvey,iambic
2668,these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,iambic
2669,compare them with the bettering of the time,iambic
2670,and though they be outstrippd by every pen,iambic
2671,reserve them for my love not for their rhyme,iambic
2672,exceeded by the height of happier men,iambic
2673,o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,iambic
2674,had my friends muse grown with this growing age,iambic
2675,a dearer birth than this his love had brought,iambic
2676,to march in ranks of better equipage,iambic
2677,but since he died and poets better prove,iambic
2678,theirs for their style ill read his for his love,iambic
2679,full many a glorious morning have i seen,iambic
2680,flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye,iambic
2681,kissing with golden face the meadows green,iambic
2682,gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy,iambic
2683,anon permit the basest clouds to ride,iambic
2684,with ugly rack on his celestial face,iambic
2685,and from the forlorn world his visage hide,iambic
2686,stealing unseen to west with this disgrace,iambic
2687,even so my sun one early morn did shine,iambic
2688,with all triumphant splendor on my brow,iambic
2689,but out alack he was but one hour mine,iambic
2690,the region cloud hath maskd him from me now,iambic
2691,yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth,iambic
2692,suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth,iambic
2693,why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,iambic
2694,and make me travel forth without my cloak,iambic
2695,to let base clouds oertake me in my way,iambic
2696,hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke,iambic
2697,tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,iambic
2698,to dry the rain on my stormbeaten face,iambic
2699,for no man well of such a salve can speak,iambic
2700,that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace,iambic
2701,nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,iambic
2702,though thou repent yet i have still the loss,iambic
2703,the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief,iambic
2704,to him that bears the strong offences cross,iambic
2705,ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,iambic
2706,and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds,iambic
2707,no more be grieved at that which thou hast done,iambic
2708,roses have thorns and silver fountains mud,iambic
2709,clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,iambic
2710,and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud,iambic
2711,all men make faults and even i in this,iambic
2712,authorizing thy trespass with compare,iambic
2713,myself corrupting salving thy amiss,iambic
2714,excusing thy sins more than thy sins are,iambic
2715,for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense,iambic
2716,thy adverse party is thy advocate,iambic
2717,and gainst myself a lawful plea commence,iambic
2718,such civil war is in my love and hate,iambic
2719,that i an accessary needs must be,iambic
2720,to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me,iambic
2721,let me confess that we two must be twain,iambic
2722,although our undivided loves are one,iambic
2723,so shall those blots that do with me remain,iambic
2724,without thy help by me be borne alone,iambic
2725,in our two loves there is but one respect,iambic
2726,though in our lives a separable spite,iambic
2727,which though it alter not loves sole effect,iambic
2728,yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight,iambic
2729,i may not evermore acknowledge thee,iambic
2730,lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,iambic
2731,nor thou with public kindness honour me,iambic
2732,unless thou take that honour from thy name,iambic
2733,but do not so i love thee in such sort,iambic
2734,as thou being mine mine is thy good report,iambic
2735,as a decrepit father takes delight,iambic
2736,to see his active child do deeds of youth,iambic
2737,so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite,iambic
2738,take all my comfort of thy worth and truth,iambic
2739,for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit,iambic
2740,or any of these all or all or more,iambic
2741,entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,iambic
2742,i make my love engrafted to this store,iambic
2743,so then i am not lame poor nor despised,iambic
2744,whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,iambic
2745,that i in thy abundance am sufficed,iambic
2746,and by a part of all thy glory live,iambic
2747,look what is best that best i wish in thee,iambic
2748,this wish i have then ten times happy me,iambic
2749,how can my muse want subject to invent,iambic
2750,while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse,iambic
2751,thine own sweet argument too excellent,iambic
2752,for every vulgar paper to rehearse,iambic
2753,o give thyself the thanks if aught in me,iambic
2754,worthy perusal stand against thy sight,iambic
2755,for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee,iambic
2756,when thou thyself dost give invention light,iambic
2757,be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth,iambic
2758,than those old nine which rhymers invocate,iambic
2759,and he that calls on thee let him bring forth,iambic
2760,eternal numbers to outlive long date,iambic
2761,if my slight muse do please these curious days,iambic
2762,the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise,iambic
2763,o how thy worth with manners may i sing,iambic
2764,when thou art all the better part of me,iambic
2765,what can mine own praise to mine own self bring,iambic
2766,and what is t but mine own when i praise thee,iambic
2767,even for this let us divided live,iambic
2768,and our dear love lose name of single one,iambic
2769,that by this separation i may give,iambic
2770,that due to thee which thou deservest alone,iambic
2771,o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,iambic
2772,were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,iambic
2773,to entertain the time with thoughts of love,iambic
2774,which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,iambic
2775,and that thou teachest how to make one twain,iambic
2776,by praising him here who doth hence remain,iambic
2777,take all my loves my love yea take them all,iambic
2778,what hast thou then more than thou hadst before,iambic
2779,no love my love that thou mayst true love call,iambic
2780,all mine was thine before thou hadst this more,iambic
2781,then if for my love thou my love receivest,iambic
2782,i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest,iambic
2783,but yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest,iambic
2784,by wilful taste of what thyself refusest,iambic
2785,i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief,iambic
2786,although thou steal thee all my poverty,iambic
2787,and yet love knows it is a greater grief,iambic
2788,to bear loves wrong than hates known injury,iambic
2789,lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows,iambic
2790,kill me with spites yet we must not be foes,iambic
2791,those petty wrongs that liberty commits,iambic
2792,when i am sometime absent from thy heart,iambic
2793,thy beauty and thy years full well befits,iambic
2794,for still temptation follows where thou art,iambic
2795,gentle thou art and therefore to be won,iambic
2796,beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed,iambic
2797,and when a woman woos what womans son,iambic
2798,will sourly leave her till she have prevailed,iambic
2799,ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,iambic
2800,and chide try beauty and thy straying youth,iambic
2801,who lead thee in their riot even there,iambic
2802,where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,iambic
2803,hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,iambic
2804,thine by thy beauty being false to me,iambic
2805,that thou hast her it is not all my grief,iambic
2806,and yet it may be said i loved her dearly,iambic
2807,that she hath thee is of my wailing chief,iambic
2808,a loss in love that touches me more nearly,iambic
2809,loving offenders thus i will excuse ye,iambic
2810,thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her,iambic
2811,and for my sake even so doth she abuse me,iambic
2812,suffering my friend for my sake to approve her,iambic
2813,if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain,iambic
2814,and losing her my friend hath found that loss,iambic
2815,both find each other and i lose both twain,iambic
2816,and both for my sake lay on me this cross,iambic
2817,but heres the joy my friend and i are one,iambic
2818,sweet flattery then she loves but me alone,iambic
2819,when most i wink then do mine eyes best see,iambic
2820,for all the day they view things unrespected,iambic
2821,but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee,iambic
2822,and darkly bright are bright in dark directed,iambic
2823,then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright,iambic
2824,how would thy shadows form form happy show,iambic
2825,to the clear day with thy much clearer light,iambic
2826,when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so,iambic
2827,how would i say mine eyes be blessed made,iambic
2828,by looking on thee in the living day,iambic
2829,when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,iambic
2830,through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay,iambic
2831,all days are nights to see till i see thee,iambic
2832,and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me,iambic
2833,if the dull substance of my flesh were thought,iambic
2834,injurious distance should not stop my way,iambic
2835,for then despite of space i would be brought,iambic
2836,from limits far remote where thou dost stay,iambic
2837,no matter then although my foot did stand,iambic
2838,upon the farthest earth removed from thee,iambic
2839,for nimble thought can jump both sea and land,iambic
2840,as soon as think the place where he would be,iambic
2841,but ah thought kills me that i am not thought,iambic
2842,to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,iambic
2843,but that so much of earth and water wrought,iambic
2844,i must attend times leisure with my moan,iambic
2845,receiving nought by elements so slow,iambic
2846,but heavy tears badges of eithers woe,iambic
2847,the other two slight air and purging fire,iambic
2848,are both with thee wherever i abide,iambic
2849,the first my thought the other my desire,iambic
2850,these presentabsent with swift motion slide,iambic
2851,for when these quicker elements are gone,iambic
2852,in tender embassy of love to thee,iambic
2853,my life being made of four with two alone,iambic
2854,sinks down to death oppressd with melancholy,iambic
2855,until lifes composition be recured,iambic
2856,by those swift messengers returnd from thee,iambic
2857,who even but now come back again assured,iambic
2858,of thy fair health recounting it to me,iambic
2859,this told i joy but then no longer glad,iambic
2860,i send them back again and straight grow sad,iambic
2861,mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,iambic
2862,how to divide the conquest of thy sight,iambic
2863,mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar,iambic
2864,my heart mine eye the freedom of that right,iambic
2865,my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,iambic
2866,a closet never pierced with crystal eyes,iambic
2867,but the defendant doth that plea deny,iambic
2868,and says in him thy fair appearance lies,iambic
2869,to cide this title is impanneled,iambic
2870,a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart,iambic
2871,and by their verdict is determined,iambic
2872,the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part,iambic
2873,as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part,iambic
2874,and my hearts right thy inward love of heart,iambic
2875,betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,iambic
2876,and each doth good turns now unto the other,iambic
2877,when that mine eye is famishd for a look,iambic
2878,or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,iambic
2879,with my loves picture then my eye doth feast,iambic
2880,and to the painted banquet bids my heart,iambic
2881,another time mine eye is my hearts guest,iambic
2882,and in his thoughts of love doth share a part,iambic
2883,so either by thy picture or my love,iambic
2884,thyself away art resent still with me,iambic
2885,for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,iambic
2886,and i am still with them and they with thee,iambic
2887,or if they sleep thy picture in my sight,iambic
2888,awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight,iambic
2889,how careful was i when i took my way,iambic
2890,each trifle under truest bars to thrust,iambic
2891,that to my use it might unused stay,iambic
2892,from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust,iambic
2893,but thou to whom my jewels trifles are,iambic
2894,most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief,iambic
2895,thou best of dearest and mine only care,iambic
2896,art left the prey of every vulgar thief,iambic
2897,thee have i not lockd up in any chest,iambic
2898,save where thou art not though i feel thou art,iambic
2899,within the gentle closure of my breast,iambic
2900,from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,iambic
2901,and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear,iambic
2902,for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear,iambic
2903,against that time if ever that time come,iambic
2904,when i shall see thee frown on my defects,iambic
2905,when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,iambic
2906,calld to that audit by advised respects,iambic
2907,against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,iambic
2908,and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,iambic
2909,when love converted from the thing it was,iambic
2910,shall reasons find of settled gravity,iambic
2911,against that time do i ensconce me here,iambic
2912,within the knowledge of mine own desert,iambic
2913,and this my hand against myself uprear,iambic
2914,to guard the lawful reasons on thy part,iambic
2915,to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,iambic
2916,since why to love i can allege no cause,iambic
2917,how heavy do i journey on the way,iambic
2918,when what i seek my weary travels end,iambic
2919,doth teach that ease and that repose to say,iambic
2920,thus far the miles are measured from thy friend,iambic
2921,the beast that bears me tired with my woe,iambic
2922,plods dully on to bear that weight in me,iambic
2923,as if by some instinct the wretch did know,iambic
2924,his rider loved not speed being made from thee,iambic
2925,the bloody spur cannot provoke him on,iambic
2926,that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,iambic
2927,which heavily he answers with a groan,iambic
2928,more sharp to me than spurring to his side,iambic
2929,for that same groan doth put this in my mind,iambic
2930,my grief lies onward and my joy behind,iambic
2931,thus can my love excuse the slow offence,iambic
2932,of my dull bearer when from thee i speed,iambic
2933,from where thou art why should i haste me thence,iambic
2934,till i return of posting is no need,iambic
2935,o what excuse will my poor beast then find,iambic
2936,when swift extremity can seem but slow,iambic
2937,then should i spur though mounted on the wind,iambic
2938,in winged speed no motion shall i know,iambic
2939,then can no horse with my desire keep pace,iambic
2940,therefore desire of perfectst love being made,iambic
2941,shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race,iambic
2942,but love for love thus shall excuse my jade,iambic
2943,since from thee going he went wilfulslow,iambic
2944,towards thee ill run and give him leave to go,iambic
2945,so am i as the rich whose blessed key,iambic
2946,can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure,iambic
2947,the which he will not every hour survey,iambic
2948,for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure,iambic
2949,therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,iambic
2950,since seldom coming in the long year set,iambic
2951,like stones of worth they thinly placed are,iambic
2952,or captain jewels in the carcanet,iambic
2953,so is the time that keeps you as my chest,iambic
2954,or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,iambic
2955,to make some special instant special blest,iambic
2956,by new unfolding his imprisond pride,iambic
2957,blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,iambic
2958,being had to triumph being lackd to hope,iambic
2959,what is your substance whereof are you made,iambic
2960,that millions of strange shadows on you tend,iambic
2961,since every one hath every one one shade,iambic
2962,and you but one can every shadow lend,iambic
2963,describe adonis and the counterfeit,iambic
2964,is poorly imitated after you,iambic
2965,on helens cheek all art of beauty set,iambic
2966,and you in grecian tires are painted new,iambic
2967,speak of the spring and foison of the year,iambic
2968,the one doth shadow of your beauty show,iambic
2969,the other as your bounty doth appear,iambic
2970,and you in every blessed shape we know,iambic
2971,in all external grace you have some part,iambic
2972,but you like none none you for constant heart,iambic
2973,o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,iambic
2974,by that sweet ornament which truth doth give,iambic
2975,the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem,iambic
2976,for that sweet odour which doth in it live,iambic
2977,the cankerblooms have full as deep a dye,iambic
2978,as the perfumed tincture of the roses,iambic
2979,hang on such thorns and play as wantonly,iambic
2980,when summers breath their masked buds discloses,iambic
2981,but for their virtue only is their show,iambic
2982,they live unwood and unrespected fade,iambic
2983,die to themselves sweet roses do not so,iambic
2984,of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made,iambic
2985,and so of you beauteous and lovely youth,iambic
2986,when that shall fade my verse distills your truth,iambic
2987,not marble nor the gilded monuments,iambic
2988,of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,iambic
2989,but you shall shine more bright in these contents,iambic
2990,than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time,iambic
2991,when wasteful war shall statues overturn,iambic
2992,and broils root out the work of masonry,iambic
2993,nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn,iambic
2994,the living record of your memory,iambic
2995,gainst death and alloblivious enmity,iambic
2996,shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room,iambic
2997,even in the eyes of all posterity,iambic
2998,that wear this world out to the ending doom,iambic
2999,so till the judgment that yourself arise,iambic
3000,you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes,iambic
3001,sweet love renew thy force be it not said,iambic
3002,thy edge should blunter be than appetite,iambic
3003,which but today by feeding is allayd,iambic
3004,tomorrow sharpend in his former might,iambic
3005,so love be thou although today thou fill,iambic
3006,thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,iambic
3007,tomorrow see again and do not kill,iambic
3008,the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness,iambic
3009,let this sad interim like the ocean be,iambic
3010,which parts the shore where two contracted new,iambic
3011,come daily to the banks that when they see,iambic
3012,return of love more blest may be the view,iambic
3013,else call it winter which being full of care,iambic
3014,makes summers welcome thrice more wishd more rare,iambic
3015,being your slave what should i do but tend,iambic
3016,upon the hours and times of your desire,iambic
3017,i have no precious time at all to spend,iambic
3018,nor services to do till you require,iambic
3019,nor dare i chide the worldwithoutend hour,iambic
3020,whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you,iambic
3021,nor think the bitterness of absence sour,iambic
3022,when you have bid your servant once adieu,iambic
3023,nor dare i question with my jealous thought,iambic
3024,where you may be or your affairs suppose,iambic
3025,but like a sad slave stay and think of nought,iambic
3026,save where you are how happy you make those,iambic
3027,so true a fool is love that in your will,iambic
3028,though you do any thing he thinks no ill,iambic
3029,that god forbid that made me first your slave,iambic
3030,i should in thought control your times of pleasure,iambic
3031,or at your hand the account of hours to crave,iambic
3032,being your vassal bound to stay your leisure,iambic
3033,o let me suffer being at your beck,iambic
3034,the imprisond absence of your liberty,iambic
3035,and patience tame to sufferance bide each cheque,iambic
3036,without accusing you of injury,iambic
3037,be where you list your charter is so strong,iambic
3038,that you yourself may privilege your time,iambic
3039,to what you will to you it doth belong,iambic
3040,yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime,iambic
3041,i am to wait though waiting so be hell,iambic
3042,not blame your pleasure be it ill or well,iambic
3043,if there be nothing new but that which is,iambic
3044,hath been before how are our brains beguiled,iambic
3045,which labouring for invention bear amiss,iambic
3046,the second burden of a former child,iambic
3047,o that record could with a backward look,iambic
3048,even of five hundred courses of the sun,iambic
3049,show me your image in some antique book,iambic
3050,since mind at first in character was done,iambic
3051,that i might see what the old world could say,iambic
3052,to this composed wonder of your frame,iambic
3053,whether we are mended or whether better they,iambic
3054,or whether revolution be the same,iambic
3055,o sure i am the wits of former days,iambic
3056,to subjects worse have given admiring praise,iambic
3057,like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,iambic
3058,so do our minutes hasten to their end,iambic
3059,each changing place with that which goes before,iambic
3060,in sequent toil all forwards do contend,iambic
3061,nativity once in the main of light,iambic
3062,crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd,iambic
3063,crooked elipses gainst his glory fight,iambic
3064,and time that gave doth now his gift confound,iambic
3065,time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,iambic
3066,and delves the parallels in beautys brow,iambic
3067,feeds on the rarities of natures truth,iambic
3068,and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow,iambic
3069,and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,iambic
3070,praising thy worth despite his cruel hand,iambic
3071,is it thy will thy image should keep open,iambic
3072,my heavy eyelids to the weary night,iambic
3073,dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,iambic
3074,while shadows like to thee do mock my sight,iambic
3075,is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee,iambic
3076,so far from home into my deeds to pry,iambic
3077,to find out shames and idle hours in me,iambic
3078,the scope and tenor of thy jealousy,iambic
3079,o no thy love though much is not so great,iambic
3080,it is my love that keeps mine eye awake,iambic
3081,mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,iambic
3082,to play the watchman ever for thy sake,iambic
3083,for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,iambic
3084,from me far off with others all too near,iambic
3085,sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye,iambic
3086,and all my soul and all my every part,iambic
3087,and for this sin there is no remedy,iambic
3088,it is so grounded inward in my heart,iambic
3089,methinks no face so gracious is as mine,iambic
3090,no shape so true no truth of such account,iambic
3091,and for myself mine own worth do define,iambic
3092,as i all other in all worths surmount,iambic
3093,but when my glass shows me myself indeed,iambic
3094,beated and choppd with tannd antiquity,iambic
3095,mine own selflove quite contrary i read,iambic
3096,self so selfloving were iniquity,iambic
3097,tis thee myself that for myself i praise,iambic
3098,painting my age with beauty of thy days,iambic
3099,against my love shall be as i am now,iambic
3100,with times injurious hand crushd and oerworn,iambic
3101,when hours have draind his blood and filld his brow,iambic
3102,with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn,iambic
3103,hath travelld on to ages steepy night,iambic
3104,and all those beauties whereof now hes king,iambic
3105,are vanishing or vanishd out of sight,iambic
3106,stealing away the treasure of his spring,iambic
3107,for such a time do i now fortify,iambic
3108,against confounding ages cruel knife,iambic
3109,that he shall never cut from memory,iambic
3110,my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life,iambic
3111,his beauty shall in these black lines be seen,iambic
3112,and they shall live and he in them still green,iambic
3113,when i have seen by times fell hand defaced,iambic
3114,the rich proud cost of outworn buried age,iambic
3115,when sometime lofty towers i see downrazed,iambic
3116,and brass eternal slave to mortal rage,iambic
3117,when i have seen the hungry ocean gain,iambic
3118,advantage on the kingdom of the shore,iambic
3119,and the firm soil win of the watery main,iambic
3120,increasing store with loss and loss with store,iambic
3121,when i have seen such interchange of state,iambic
3122,or state itself confounded to decay,iambic
3123,ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,iambic
3124,that time will come and take my love away,iambic
3125,this thought is as a death which cannot choose,iambic
3126,but weep to have that which it fears to lose,iambic
3127,since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea,iambic
3128,but sad mortality oersways their power,iambic
3129,how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,iambic
3130,whose action is no stronger than a flower,iambic
3131,o how shall summers honey breath hold out,iambic
3132,against the wreckful siege of battering days,iambic
3133,when rocks impregnable are not so stout,iambic
3134,nor gates of steel so strong but time decays,iambic
3135,o fearful meditation where alack,iambic
3136,shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid,iambic
3137,or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,iambic
3138,or who his spoil of beauty can forbid,iambic
3139,o none unless this miracle have might,iambic
3140,that in black ink my love may still shine bright,iambic
3141,tired with all these for restful death i cry,iambic
3142,as to behold desert a beggar born,iambic
3143,and needy nothing trimmd in jollity,iambic
3144,and purest faith unhappily forsworn,iambic
3145,and guilded honour shamefully misplaced,iambic
3146,and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,iambic
3147,and right perfection wrongfully disgraced,iambic
3148,and strength by limping sway disabled,iambic
3149,and art made tonguetied by authority,iambic
3150,and folly doctorlike controlling skill,iambic
3151,and simple truth miscalld simplicity,iambic
3152,and captive good attending captain ill,iambic
3153,tired with all these from these would i be gone,iambic
3154,save that to die i leave my love alone,iambic
3155,ah wherefore with infection should he live,iambic
3156,and with his presence grace impiety,iambic
3157,that sin by him advantage should achieve,iambic
3158,and lace itself with his society,iambic
3159,why should false painting imitate his cheek,iambic
3160,and steal dead seeing of his living hue,iambic
3161,why should poor beauty indirectly seek,iambic
3162,roses of shadow since his rose is true,iambic
3163,why should he live now nature bankrupt is,iambic
3164,beggard of blood to blush through lively veins,iambic
3165,for she hath no exchequer now but his,iambic
3166,and proud of many lives upon his gains,iambic
3167,o him she stores to show what wealth she had,iambic
3168,in days long since before these last so bad,iambic
3169,thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,iambic
3170,when beauty lived and died as flowers do now,iambic
3171,before the bastard signs of fair were born,iambic
3172,or durst inhabit on a living brow,iambic
3173,before the golden tresses of the dead,iambic
3174,the right of sepulchres were shorn away,iambic
3175,to live a second life on second head,iambic
3176,ere beautys dead fleece made another gay,iambic
3177,in him those holy antique hours are seen,iambic
3178,without all ornament itself and true,iambic
3179,making no summer of anothers green,iambic
3180,robbing no old to dress his beauty new,iambic
3181,and him as for a map doth nature store,iambic
3182,to show false art what beauty was of yore,iambic
3183,those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view,iambic
3184,want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend,iambic
3185,all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due,iambic
3186,uttering bare truth even so as foes commend,iambic
3187,thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd,iambic
3188,but those same tongues that give thee so thine own,iambic
3189,in other accents do this praise confound,iambic
3190,by seeing farther than the eye hath shown,iambic
3191,they look into the beauty of thy mind,iambic
3192,and that in guess they measure by thy deeds,iambic
3193,then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind,iambic
3194,to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds,iambic
3195,but why thy odour matcheth not thy show,iambic
3196,the solve is this that thou dost common grow,iambic
3197,that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,iambic
3198,for slanders mark was ever yet the fair,iambic
3199,the ornament of beauty is suspect,iambic
3200,a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air,iambic
3201,so thou be good slander doth but approve,iambic
3202,thy worth the greater being wood of time,iambic
3203,for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,iambic
3204,and thou presentst a pure unstained prime,iambic
3205,thou hast passd by the ambush of young days,iambic
3206,either not assaild or victor being charged,iambic
3207,yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,iambic
3208,to tie up envy evermore enlarged,iambic
3209,if some suspect of ill maskd not thy show,iambic
3210,then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe,iambic
3211,no longer mourn for me when i am dead,iambic
3212,then you shall hear the surly sullen bell,iambic
3213,give warning to the world that i am fled,iambic
3214,from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell,iambic
3215,nay if you read this line remember not,iambic
3216,the hand that writ it for i love you so,iambic
3217,that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,iambic
3218,if thinking on me then should make you woe,iambic
3219,o if i say you look upon this verse,iambic
3220,when i perhaps compounded am with clay,iambic
3221,do not so much as my poor name rehearse,iambic
3222,but let your love even with my life decay,iambic
3223,lest the wise world should look into your moan,iambic
3224,and mock you with me after i am gone,iambic
3225,o lest the world should task you to recite,iambic
3226,what merit lived in me that you should love,iambic
3227,after my death dear love forget me quite,iambic
3228,for you in me can nothing worthy prove,iambic
3229,unless you would devise some virtuous lie,iambic
3230,to do more for me than mine own desert,iambic
3231,and hang more praise upon deceased i,iambic
3232,than niggard truth would willingly impart,iambic
3233,o lest your true love may seem false in this,iambic
3234,that you for love speak well of me untrue,iambic
3235,my name be buried where my body is,iambic
3236,and live no more to shame nor me nor you,iambic
3237,for i am shamed by that which i bring forth,iambic
3238,and so should you to love things nothing worth,iambic
3239,that time of year thou mayst in me behold,iambic
3240,when yellow leaves or none or few do hang,iambic
3241,upon those boughs which shake against the cold,iambic
3242,bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang,iambic
3243,in me thou seest the twilight of such day,iambic
3244,as after sunset fadeth in the west,iambic
3245,which by and by black night doth take away,iambic
3246,deaths second self that seals up all in rest,iambic
3247,in me thou seest the glowing of such fire,iambic
3248,that on the ashes of his youth doth lie,iambic
3249,as the deathbed whereon it must expire,iambic
3250,consumed with that which it was nourishd by,iambic
3251,this thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong,iambic
3252,to love that well which thou must leave ere long,iambic
3253,but be contented when that fell arrest,iambic
3254,without all bail shall carry me away,iambic
3255,my life hath in this line some interest,iambic
3256,which for memorial still with thee shall stay,iambic
3257,when thou reviewest this thou dost review,iambic
3258,the very part was consecrate to thee,iambic
3259,the earth can have but earth which is his due,iambic
3260,my spirit is thine the better part of me,iambic
3261,so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,iambic
3262,the prey of worms my body being dead,iambic
3263,the coward conquest of a wretchs knife,iambic
3264,too base of thee to be remembered,iambic
3265,the worth of that is that which it contains,iambic
3266,and that is this and this with thee remains,iambic
3267,so are you to my thoughts as food to life,iambic
3268,or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground,iambic
3269,and for the peace of you i hold such strife,iambic
3270,as twixt a miser and his wealth is found,iambic
3271,now proud as an enjoyer and anon,iambic
3272,doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,iambic
3273,now counting best to be with you alone,iambic
3274,then betterd that the world may see my pleasure,iambic
3275,sometime all full with feasting on your sight,iambic
3276,and by and by clean starved for a look,iambic
3277,possessing or pursuing no delight,iambic
3278,save what is had or must from you be took,iambic
3279,thus do i pine and surfeit day by day,iambic
3280,or gluttoning on all or all away,iambic
3281,why is my verse so barren of new pride,iambic
3282,so far from variation or quick change,iambic
3283,why with the time do i not glance aside,iambic
3284,to newfound methods and to compounds strange,iambic
3285,why write i still all one ever the same,iambic
3286,and keep invention in a noted weed,iambic
3287,that every word doth almost tell my name,iambic
3288,showing their birth and where they did proceed,iambic
3289,o know sweet love i always write of you,iambic
3290,and you and love are still my argument,iambic
3291,so all my best is dressing old words new,iambic
3292,spending again what is already spent,iambic
3293,for as the sun is daily new and old,iambic
3294,so is my love still telling what is told,iambic
3295,thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,iambic
3296,thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,iambic
3297,the vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear,iambic
3298,and of this book this learning mayst thou taste,iambic
3299,the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,iambic
3300,of mouthed graves will give thee memory,iambic
3301,thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know,iambic
3302,times thievish progress to eternity,iambic
3303,look what thy memory can not contain,iambic
3304,commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find,iambic
3305,those children nursed deliverd from thy brain,iambic
3306,to take a new acquaintance of thy mind,iambic
3307,these offices so oft as thou wilt look,iambic
3308,shall profit thee and much enrich thy book,iambic
3309,so oft have i invoked thee for my muse,iambic
3310,and found such fair assistance in my verse,iambic
3311,as every alien pen hath got my use,iambic
3312,and under thee their poesy disperse,iambic
3313,thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing,iambic
3314,and heavy ignorance aloft to fly,iambic
3315,have added feathers to the learneds wing,iambic
3316,and given grace a double majesty,iambic
3317,yet be most proud of that which i compile,iambic
3318,whose influence is thine and born of thee,iambic
3319,in others works thou dost but mend the style,iambic
3320,and arts with thy sweet graces graced be,iambic
3321,but thou art all my art and dost advance,iambic
3322,as high as learning my rude ignorance,iambic
3323,whilst i alone did call upon thy aid,iambic
3324,my verse alone had all thy gentle grace,iambic
3325,but now my gracious numbers are decayd,iambic
3326,and my sick muse doth give another place,iambic
3327,i grant sweet love thy lovely argument,iambic
3328,deserves the travail of a worthier pen,iambic
3329,yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,iambic
3330,he robs thee of and pays it thee again,iambic
3331,he lends thee virtue and he stole that word,iambic
3332,from thy behavior beauty doth he give,iambic
3333,and found it in thy cheek he can afford,iambic
3334,no praise to thee but what in thee doth live,iambic
3335,then thank him not for that which he doth say,iambic
3336,since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay,iambic
3337,o how i faint when i of you do write,iambic
3338,knowing a better spirit doth use your name,iambic
3339,and in the praise thereof spends all his might,iambic
3340,to make me tonguetied speaking of your fame,iambic
3341,but since your worth wide as the ocean is,iambic
3342,the humble as the proudest sail doth bear,iambic
3343,my saucy bark inferior far to his,iambic
3344,on your broad main doth wilfully appear,iambic
3345,your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,iambic
3346,whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,iambic
3347,or being wreckd i am a worthless boat,iambic
3348,he of tall building and of goodly pride,iambic
3349,then if he thrive and i be cast away,iambic
3350,the worst was this my love was my decay,iambic
3351,or i shall live your epitaph to make,iambic
3352,or you survive when i in earth am rotten,iambic
3353,from hence your memory death cannot take,iambic
3354,although in me each part will be forgotten,iambic
3355,your name from hence immortal life shall have,iambic
3356,though i once gone to all the world must die,iambic
3357,the earth can yield me but a common grave,iambic
3358,when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie,iambic
3359,your monument shall be my gentle verse,iambic
3360,which eyes not yet created shall oerread,iambic
3361,and tongues to be your being shall rehearse,iambic
3362,when all the breathers of this world are dead,iambic
3363,you still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen,iambic
3364,where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men,iambic
3365,i grant thou wert not married to my muse,iambic
3366,and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook,iambic
3367,the dedicated words which writers use,iambic
3368,of their fair subject blessing every book,iambic
3369,thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,iambic
3370,finding thy worth a limit past my praise,iambic
3371,and therefore art enforced to seek anew,iambic
3372,some fresher stamp of the timebettering days,iambic
3373,and do so love yet when they have devised,iambic
3374,what strained touches rhetoric can lend,iambic
3375,thou truly fair wert truly sympathized,iambic
3376,in true plain words by thy truetelling friend,iambic
3377,and their gross painting might be better used,iambic
3378,where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused,iambic
3379,i never saw that you did painting need,iambic
3380,and therefore to your fair no painting set,iambic
3381,i found or thought i found you did exceed,iambic
3382,the barren tender of a poets debt,iambic
3383,and therefore have i slept in your report,iambic
3384,that you yourself being extant well might show,iambic
3385,how far a modern quill doth come too short,iambic
3386,speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow,iambic
3387,this silence for my sin you did impute,iambic
3388,which shall be most my glory being dumb,iambic
3389,for i impair not beauty being mute,iambic
3390,when others would give life and bring a tomb,iambic
3391,there lives more life in one of your fair eyes,iambic
3392,than both your poets can in praise devise,iambic
3393,who is it that says most which can say more,iambic
3394,than this rich praise that you alone are you,iambic
3395,in whose confine immured is the store,iambic
3396,which should example where your equal grew,iambic
3397,lean penury within that pen doth dwell,iambic
3398,that to his subject lends not some small glory,iambic
3399,but he that writes of you if he can tell,iambic
3400,that you are you so dignifies his story,iambic
3401,let him but copy what in you is writ,iambic
3402,not making worse what nature made so clear,iambic
3403,and such a counterpart shall fame his wit,iambic
3404,making his style admired every where,iambic
3405,you to your beauteous blessings add a curse,iambic
3406,being fond on praise which makes your praises worse,iambic
3407,my tonguetied muse in manners holds her still,iambic
3408,while comments of your praise richly compiled,iambic
3409,reserve their character with golden quill,iambic
3410,and precious phrase by all the muses filed,iambic
3411,i think good thoughts whilst other write good words,iambic
3412,and like unletterd clerk still cry amen,iambic
3413,to every hymn that able spirit affords,iambic
3414,in polishd form of wellrefined pen,iambic
3415,hearing you praised i say tis so tis true,iambic
3416,and to the most of praise add something more,iambic
3417,but that is in my thought whose love to you,iambic
3418,though words come hindmost holds his rank before,iambic
3419,then others for the breath of words respect,iambic
3420,me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect,iambic
3421,was it the proud full sail of his great verse,iambic
3422,bound for the prize of all too precious you,iambic
3423,that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,iambic
3424,making their tomb the womb wherein they grew,iambic
3425,was it his spirit by spirits taught to write,iambic
3426,above a mortal pitch that struck me dead,iambic
3427,no neither he nor his compeers by night,iambic
3428,giving him aid my verse astonished,iambic
3429,he nor that affable familiar ghost,iambic
3430,which nightly gulls him with intelligence,iambic
3431,as victors of my silence cannot boast,iambic
3432,i was not sick of any fear from thence,iambic
3433,but when your countenance filld up his line,iambic
3434,then lackd i matter that enfeebled mine,iambic
3435,farewell thou art too dear for my possessing,iambic
3436,and like enough thou knowst thy estimate,iambic
3437,the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing,iambic
3438,my bonds in thee are all determinate,iambic
3439,for how do i hold thee but by thy granting,iambic
3440,and for that riches where is my deserving,iambic
3441,the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,iambic
3442,and so my patent back again is swerving,iambic
3443,thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing,iambic
3444,or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking,iambic
3445,so thy great gift upon misprision growing,iambic
3446,comes home again on better judgment making,iambic
3447,thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter,iambic
3448,in sleep a king but waking no such matter,iambic
3449,when thou shalt be disposed to set me light,iambic
3450,and place my merit in the eye of scorn,iambic
3451,upon thy side against myself ill fight,iambic
3452,and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn,iambic
3453,with mine own weakness being best acquainted,iambic
3454,upon thy part i can set down a story,iambic
3455,of faults conceald wherein i am attainted,iambic
3456,that thou in losing me shalt win much glory,iambic
3457,and i by this will be a gainer too,iambic
3458,for bending all my loving thoughts on thee,iambic
3459,the injuries that to myself i do,iambic
3460,doing thee vantage doublevantage me,iambic
3461,such is my love to thee i so belong,iambic
3462,that for thy right myself will bear all wrong,iambic
3463,say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,iambic
3464,and i will comment upon that offence,iambic
3465,speak of my lameness and i straight will halt,iambic
3466,against thy reasons making no defence,iambic
3467,thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,iambic
3468,to set a form upon desired change,iambic
3469,as ill myself disgrace knowing thy will,iambic
3470,i will acquaintance strangle and look strange,iambic
3471,be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,iambic
3472,thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,iambic
3473,lest i too much profane should do it wrong,iambic
3474,and haply of our old acquaintance tell,iambic
3475,for thee against myself ill vow debate,iambic
3476,for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate,iambic
3477,then hate me when thou wilt if ever now,iambic
3478,now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,iambic
3479,join with the spite of fortune make me bow,iambic
3480,and do not drop in for an afterloss,iambic
3481,ah do not when my heart hath scoped this sorrow,iambic
3482,come in the rearward of a conquerd woe,iambic
3483,give not a windy night a rainy morrow,iambic
3484,to linger out a purposed overthrow,iambic
3485,if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last,iambic
3486,when other petty griefs have done their spite,iambic
3487,but in the onset come so shall i taste,iambic
3488,at first the very worst of fortunes might,iambic
3489,and other strains of woe which now seem woe,iambic
3490,compared with loss of thee will not seem so,iambic
3491,some glory in their birth some in their skill,iambic
3492,some in their wealth some in their bodies force,iambic
3493,some in their garments though newfangled ill,iambic
3494,some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse,iambic
3495,and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,iambic
3496,wherein it finds a joy above the rest,iambic
3497,but these particulars are not my measure,iambic
3498,all these i better in one general best,iambic
3499,thy love is better than high birth to me,iambic
3500,richer than wealth prouder than garments cost,iambic
3501,of more delight than hawks or horses be,iambic
3502,and having thee of all mens pride i boast,iambic
3503,wretched in this alone that thou mayst take,iambic
3504,all this away and me most wretched make,iambic
3505,but do thy worst to steal thyself away,iambic
3506,for term of life thou art assured mine,iambic
3507,and life no longer than thy love will stay,iambic
3508,for it depends upon that love of thine,iambic
3509,then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs,iambic
3510,when in the least of them my life hath end,iambic
3511,i see a better state to me belongs,iambic
3512,than that which on thy humour doth depend,iambic
3513,thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,iambic
3514,since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,iambic
3515,o what a happy title do i find,iambic
3516,happy to have thy love happy to die,iambic
3517,but whats so blessedfair that fears no blot,iambic
3518,thou mayst be false and yet i know it not,iambic
3519,so shall i live supposing thou art true,iambic
3520,like a deceived husband so loves face,iambic
3521,may still seem love to me though alterd new,iambic
3522,thy looks with me thy heart in other place,iambic
3523,for there can live no hatred in thine eye,iambic
3524,therefore in that i cannot know thy change,iambic
3525,in manys looks the false hearts history,iambic
3526,is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,iambic
3527,but heaven in thy creation did decree,iambic
3528,that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,iambic
3529,whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be,iambic
3530,thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell,iambic
3531,how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow,iambic
3532,if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show,iambic
3533,they that have power to hurt and will do none,iambic
3534,that do not do the thing they most do show,iambic
3535,who moving others are themselves as stone,iambic
3536,unmoved cold and to temptation slow,iambic
3537,they rightly do inherit heavens graces,iambic
3538,and husband natures riches from expense,iambic
3539,they are the lords and owners of their faces,iambic
3540,others but stewards of their excellence,iambic
3541,the summers flower is to the summer sweet,iambic
3542,though to itself it only live and die,iambic
3543,but if that flower with base infection meet,iambic
3544,the basest weed outbraves his dignity,iambic
3545,for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,iambic
3546,lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds,iambic
3547,how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,iambic
3548,which like a canker in the fragrant rose,iambic
3549,doth spot the beauty of thy budding name,iambic
3550,o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose,iambic
3551,that tongue that tells the story of thy days,iambic
3552,making lascivious comments on thy sport,iambic
3553,cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise,iambic
3554,naming thy name blesses an ill report,iambic
3555,o what a mansion have those vices got,iambic
3556,which for their habitation chose out thee,iambic
3557,where beautys veil doth cover every blot,iambic
3558,and all things turn to fair that eyes can see,iambic
3559,take heed dear heart of this large privilege,iambic
3560,the hardest knife illused doth lose his edge,iambic
3561,some say thy fault is youth some wantonness,iambic
3562,some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,iambic
3563,both grace and faults are loved of more and less,iambic
3564,thou makest faults graces that to thee resort,iambic
3565,as on the finger of a throned queen,iambic
3566,the basest jewel will be well esteemd,iambic
3567,so are those errors that in thee are seen,iambic
3568,to truths translated and for true things deemd,iambic
3569,how many lambs might the stem wolf betray,iambic
3570,if like a lamb he could his looks translate,iambic
3571,how many gazers mightst thou lead away,iambic
3572,if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state,iambic
3573,but do not so i love thee in such sort,iambic
3574,as thou being mine mine is thy good report,iambic
3575,how like a winter hath my absence been,iambic
3576,from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year,iambic
3577,what freezings have i felt what dark days seen,iambic
3578,what old decembers bareness every where,iambic
3579,and yet this time removed was summers time,iambic
3580,the teeming autumn big with rich increase,iambic
3581,bearing the wanton burden of the prime,iambic
3582,like widowd wombs after their lords decease,iambic
3583,yet this abundant issue seemd to me,iambic
3584,but hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit,iambic
3585,for summer and his pleasures wait on thee,iambic
3586,and thou away the very birds are mute,iambic
3587,or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer,iambic
3588,that leaves look pale dreading the winters near,iambic
3589,from you have i been absent in the spring,iambic
3590,when proudpied april dressd in all his trim,iambic
3591,hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,iambic
3592,that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him,iambic
3593,yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell,iambic
3594,of different flowers in odour and in hue,iambic
3595,could make me any summers story tell,iambic
3596,or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew,iambic
3597,nor did i wonder at the lilys white,iambic
3598,nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,iambic
3599,they were but sweet but figures of delight,iambic
3600,drawn after you you pattern of all those,iambic
3601,yet seemd it winter still and you away,iambic
3602,as with your shadow i with these did play,iambic
3603,the forward violet thus did i chide,iambic
3604,sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,iambic
3605,if not from my loves breath the purple pride,iambic
3606,which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells,iambic
3607,in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed,iambic
3608,the lily i condemned for thy hand,iambic
3609,and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair,iambic
3610,the roses fearfully on thorns did stand,iambic
3611,one blushing shame another white despair,iambic
3612,a third nor red nor white had stoln of both,iambic
3613,and to his robbery had annexd thy breath,iambic
3614,but for his theft in pride of all his growth,iambic
3615,a vengeful canker eat him up to death,iambic
3616,more flowers i noted yet i none could see,iambic
3617,but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee,iambic
3618,where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long,iambic
3619,to speak of that which gives thee all thy might,iambic
3620,spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song,iambic
3621,darkening thy power to lend base subjects light,iambic
3622,return forgetful muse and straight redeem,iambic
3623,in gentle numbers time so idly spent,iambic
3624,sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,iambic
3625,and gives thy pen both skill and argument,iambic
3626,rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey,iambic
3627,if time have any wrinkle graven there,iambic
3628,if any be a satire to decay,iambic
3629,and make times spoils despised every where,iambic
3630,give my love fame faster than time wastes life,iambic
3631,so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife,iambic
3632,o truant muse what shall be thy amends,iambic
3633,for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed,iambic
3634,both truth and beauty on my love depends,iambic
3635,so dost thou too and therein dignified,iambic
3636,make answer muse wilt thou not haply say,iambic
3637,truth needs no colour with his colour fixd,iambic
3638,beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay,iambic
3639,but best is best if never intermixd,iambic
3640,because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb,iambic
3641,excuse not silence so fort lies in thee,iambic
3642,to make him much outlive a gilded tomb,iambic
3643,and to be praised of ages yet to be,iambic
3644,then do thy office muse i teach thee how,iambic
3645,to make him seem long hence as he shows now,iambic
3646,my love is strengthend though more weak in seeming,iambic
3647,i love not less though less the show appear,iambic
3648,that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming,iambic
3649,the owners tongue doth publish every where,iambic
3650,our love was new and then but in the spring,iambic
3651,when i was wont to greet it with my lays,iambic
3652,as philomel in summers front doth sing,iambic
3653,and stops her pipe in growth of riper days,iambic
3654,not that the summer is less pleasant now,iambic
3655,than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,iambic
3656,but that wild music burthens every bough,iambic
3657,and sweets grown common lose their dear delight,iambic
3658,therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue,iambic
3659,because i would not dull you with my song,iambic
3660,alack what poverty my muse brings forth,iambic
3661,that having such a scope to show her pride,iambic
3662,the argument all bare is of more worth,iambic
3663,than when it hath my added praise beside,iambic
3664,o blame me not if i no more can write,iambic
3665,look in your glass and there appears a face,iambic
3666,that overgoes my blunt invention quite,iambic
3667,dulling my lines and doing me disgrace,iambic
3668,were it not sinful then striving to mend,iambic
3669,to mar the subject that before was well,iambic
3670,for to no other pass my verses tend,iambic
3671,than of your graces and your gifts to tell,iambic
3672,and more much more than in my verse can sit,iambic
3673,your own glass shows you when you look in it,iambic
3674,to me fair friend you never can be old,iambic
3675,for as you were when first your eye i eyed,iambic
3676,such seems your beauty still three winters cold,iambic
3677,have from the forests shook three summers pride,iambic
3678,three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd,iambic
3679,in process of the seasons have i seen,iambic
3680,three april perfumes in three hot junes burnd,iambic
3681,since first i saw you fresh which yet are green,iambic
3682,ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand,iambic
3683,steal from his figure and no pace perceived,iambic
3684,so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand,iambic
3685,hath motion and mine eye may be deceived,iambic
3686,for fear of which hear this thou age unbred,iambic
3687,ere you were born was beautys summer dead,iambic
3688,let not my love be calld idolatry,iambic
3689,nor my beloved as an idol show,iambic
3690,since all alike my songs and praises be,iambic
3691,to one of one still such and ever so,iambic
3692,kind is my love today tomorrow kind,iambic
3693,still constant in a wondrous excellence,iambic
3694,therefore my verse to constancy confined,iambic
3695,one thing expressing leaves out difference,iambic
3696,fair kind and true is all my argument,iambic
3697,fair kind and true varying to other words,iambic
3698,and in this change is my invention spent,iambic
3699,three themes in one which wondrous scope affords,iambic
3700,fair kind and true have often lived alone,iambic
3701,which three till now never kept seat in one,iambic
3702,when in the chronicle of wasted time,iambic
3703,i see descriptions of the fairest wights,iambic
3704,and beauty making beautiful old rhyme,iambic
3705,in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,iambic
3706,then in the blazon of sweet beautys best,iambic
3707,of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow,iambic
3708,i see their antique pen would have expressd,iambic
3709,even such a beauty as you master now,iambic
3710,so all their praises are but prophecies,iambic
3711,of this our time all you prefiguring,iambic
3712,and for they lookd but with divining eyes,iambic
3713,they had not skill enough your worth to sing,iambic
3714,for we which now behold these present days,iambic
3715,had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise,iambic
3716,not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul,iambic
3717,of the wide world dreaming on things to come,iambic
3718,can yet the lease of my true love control,iambic
3719,supposed as forfeit to a confined doom,iambic
3720,the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,iambic
3721,and the sad augurs mock their own presage,iambic
3722,incertainties now crown themselves assured,iambic
3723,and peace proclaims olives of endless age,iambic
3724,now with the drops of this most balmy time,iambic
3725,my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes,iambic
3726,since spite of him ill live in this poor rhyme,iambic
3727,while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes,iambic
3728,and thou in this shalt find thy monument,iambic
3729,when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent,iambic
3730,whats in the brain that ink may character,iambic
3731,which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,iambic
3732,whats new to speak what new to register,iambic
3733,that may express my love or thy dear merit,iambic
3734,nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine,iambic
3735,i must each day say oer the very same,iambic
3736,counting no old thing old thou mine i thine,iambic
3737,even as when first i hallowd thy fair name,iambic
3738,so that eternal love in loves fresh case,iambic
3739,weighs not the dust and injury of age,iambic
3740,nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,iambic
3741,but makes antiquity for aye his page,iambic
3742,finding the first conceit of love there bred,iambic
3743,where time and outward form would show it dead,iambic
3744,o never say that i was false of heart,iambic
3745,though absence seemd my flame to qualify,iambic
3746,as easy might i from myself depart,iambic
3747,as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie,iambic
3748,that is my home of love if i have ranged,iambic
3749,like him that travels i return again,iambic
3750,just to the time not with the time exchanged,iambic
3751,so that myself bring water for my stain,iambic
3752,never believe though in my nature reignd,iambic
3753,all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,iambic
3754,that it could so preposterously be staind,iambic
3755,to leave for nothing all thy sum of good,iambic
3756,for nothing this wide universe i call,iambic
3757,save thou my rose in it thou art my all,iambic
3758,alas tis true i have gone here and there,iambic
3759,and made myself a motley to the view,iambic
3760,gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear,iambic
3761,made old offences of affections new,iambic
3762,most true it is that i have lookd on truth,iambic
3763,askance and strangely but by all above,iambic
3764,these blenches gave my heart another youth,iambic
3765,and worse essays proved thee my best of love,iambic
3766,now all is done have what shall have no end,iambic
3767,mine appetite i never more will grind,iambic
3768,on newer proof to try an older friend,iambic
3769,a god in love to whom i am confined,iambic
3770,then give me welcome next my heaven the best,iambic
3771,even to thy pure and most most loving breast,iambic
3772,o for my sake do you with fortune chide,iambic
3773,the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,iambic
3774,that did not better for my life provide,iambic
3775,than public means which public manners breeds,iambic
3776,thence comes it that my name receives a brand,iambic
3777,and almost thence my nature is subdued,iambic
3778,to what it works in like the dyers hand,iambic
3779,pity me then and wish i were renewd,iambic
3780,whilst like a willing patient i will drink,iambic
3781,potions of eisel gainst my strong infection,iambic
3782,no bitterness that i will bitter think,iambic
3783,nor double penance to correct correction,iambic
3784,pity me then dear friend and i assure ye,iambic
3785,even that your pity is enough to cure me,iambic
3786,your love and pity doth the impression fill,iambic
3787,which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow,iambic
3788,for what care i who calls me well or ill,iambic
3789,so you oergreen my bad my good allow,iambic
3790,you are my all the world and i must strive,iambic
3791,to know my shames and praises from your tongue,iambic
3792,none else to me nor i to none alive,iambic
3793,that my steeld sense or changes right or wrong,iambic
3794,in so profound abysm i throw all care,iambic
3795,of others voices that my adders sense,iambic
3796,to critic and to flatterer stopped are,iambic
3797,mark how with my neglect i do dispense,iambic
3798,you are so strongly in my purpose bred,iambic
3799,that all the world besides methinks are dead,iambic
3800,since i left you mine eye is in my mind,iambic
3801,and that which governs me to go about,iambic
3802,doth part his function and is partly blind,iambic
3803,seems seeing but effectually is out,iambic
3804,for it no form delivers to the heart,iambic
3805,of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch,iambic
3806,of his quick objects hath the mind no part,iambic
3807,nor his own vision holds what it doth catch,iambic
3808,for if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,iambic
3809,the most sweet favour or deformedst creature,iambic
3810,the mountain or the sea the day or night,iambic
3811,the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature,iambic
3812,incapable of more replete with you,iambic
3813,my most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue,iambic
3814,or whether doth my mind being crownd with you,iambic
3815,drink up the monarchs plague this flattery,iambic
3816,or whether shall i say mine eye saith true,iambic
3817,and that your love taught it this alchemy,iambic
3818,to make of monsters and things indigest,iambic
3819,such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,iambic
3820,creating every bad a perfect best,iambic
3821,as fast as objects to his beams assemble,iambic
3822,otis the first tis flattery in my seeing,iambic
3823,and my great mind most kingly drinks it up,iambic
3824,mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing,iambic
3825,and to his palate doth prepare the cup,iambic
3826,if it be poisond tis the lesser sin,iambic
3827,that mine eye loves it and doth first begin,iambic
3828,those lines that i before have writ do lie,iambic
3829,even those that said i could not love you dearer,iambic
3830,yet then my judgment knew no reason why,iambic
3831,my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,iambic
3832,but reckoning time whose milliond accidents,iambic
3833,creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings,iambic
3834,tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents,iambic
3835,divert strong minds to the course of altering things,iambic
3836,alas why fearing of times tyranny,iambic
3837,might i not then say now i love you best,iambic
3838,when i was certain oer incertainty,iambic
3839,crowning the present doubting of the rest,iambic
3840,love is a babe then might i not say so,iambic
3841,to give full growth to that which still doth grow,iambic
3842,let me not to the marriage of true minds,iambic
3843,admit impediments love is not love,iambic
3844,which alters when it alteration finds,iambic
3845,or bends with the remover to remove,iambic
3846,o no it is an everfixed mark,iambic
3847,that looks on tempests and is never shaken,iambic
3848,it is the star to every wandering bark,iambic
3849,whose worths unknown although his height be taken,iambic
3850,loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks,iambic
3851,within his bending sickles compass come,iambic
3852,love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,iambic
3853,but bears it out even to the edge of doom,iambic
3854,if this be error and upon me proved,iambic
3855,i never writ nor no man ever loved,iambic
3856,accuse me thus that i have scanted all,iambic
3857,wherein i should your great deserts repay,iambic
3858,forgot upon your dearest love to call,iambic
3859,whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,iambic
3860,that i have frequent been with unknown minds,iambic
3861,and given to time your own dearpurchased right,iambic
3862,that i have hoisted sail to all the winds,iambic
3863,which should transport me farthest from your sight,iambic
3864,book both my wilfulness and errors down,iambic
3865,and on just proof surmise accumulate,iambic
3866,bring me within the level of your frown,iambic
3867,but shoot not at me in your wakend hate,iambic
3868,since my appeal says i did strive to prove,iambic
3869,the constancy and virtue of your love,iambic
3870,like as to make our appetites more keen,iambic
3871,with eager compounds we our palate urge,iambic
3872,as to prevent our maladies unseen,iambic
3873,we sicken to shun sickness when we purge,iambic
3874,even so being tuff of your neercloying sweetness,iambic
3875,to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding,iambic
3876,and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,iambic
3877,to be diseased ere that there was true needing,iambic
3878,thus policy in love to anticipate,iambic
3879,the ills that were not grew to faults assured,iambic
3880,and brought to medicine a healthful state,iambic
3881,which rank of goodness would by ill be cured,iambic
3882,but thence i learn and find the lesson true,iambic
3883,drugs poison him that so fell sick of you,iambic
3884,what potions have i drunk of siren tears,iambic
3885,distilld from limbecks foul as hell within,iambic
3886,applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,iambic
3887,still losing when i saw myself to win,iambic
3888,what wretched errors hath my heart committed,iambic
3889,whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never,iambic
3890,how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,iambic
3891,in the distraction of this madding fever,iambic
3892,o benefit of ill now i find true,iambic
3893,that better is by evil still made better,iambic
3894,and ruind love when it is built anew,iambic
3895,grows fairer than at first more strong far greater,iambic
3896,so i return rebuked to my content,iambic
3897,and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent,iambic
3898,that you were once unkind befriends me now,iambic
3899,and for that sorrow which i then did feel,iambic
3900,needs must i under my transgression bow,iambic
3901,unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel,iambic
3902,for if you were by my unkindness shaken,iambic
3903,as i by yours youve passd a hell of time,iambic
3904,and i a tyrant have no leisure taken,iambic
3905,to weigh how once i suffered in your crime,iambic
3906,o that our night of woe might have rememberd,iambic
3907,my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits,iambic
3908,and soon to you as you to me then tenderd,iambic
3909,the humble slave which wounded bosoms fits,iambic
3910,but that your trespass now becomes a fee,iambic
3911,mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me,iambic
3912,tis better to be vile than vile esteemd,iambic
3913,when not to be receives reproach of being,iambic
3914,and the just pleasure lost which is so deemd,iambic
3915,not by our feeling but by others seeing,iambic
3916,for why should others false adulterate eyes,iambic
3917,give salutation to my sportive blood,iambic
3918,or on my frailties why are frailer spies,iambic
3919,which in their wills count bad what i think good,iambic
3920,no i am that i am and they that level,iambic
3921,at my abuses reckon up their own,iambic
3922,i may be straight though they themselves be bevel,iambic
3923,by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown,iambic
3924,unless this general evil they maintain,iambic
3925,all men are bad and in their badness reign,iambic
3926,thy gift thy tables are within my brain,iambic
3927,full characterd with lasting memory,iambic
3928,which shall above that idle rank remain,iambic
3929,beyond all date even to eternity,iambic
3930,or at the least so long as brain and heart,iambic
3931,have faculty by nature to subsist,iambic
3932,till each to razed oblivion yield his part,iambic
3933,of thee thy record never can be missd,iambic
3934,that poor retention could not so much hold,iambic
3935,nor need i tallies thy dear love to score,iambic
3936,therefore to give them from me was i bold,iambic
3937,to trust those tables that receive thee more,iambic
3938,to keep an adjunct to remember thee,iambic
3939,were to import forgetfulness in me,iambic
3940,no time thou shalt not boast that i do change,iambic
3941,thy pyramids built up with newer might,iambic
3942,to me are nothing novel nothing strange,iambic
3943,they are but dressings of a former sight,iambic
3944,our dates are brief and therefore we admire,iambic
3945,what thou dost foist upon us that is old,iambic
3946,and rather make them born to our desire,iambic
3947,than think that we before have heard them told,iambic
3948,thy registers and thee i both defy,iambic
3949,not wondering at the present nor the past,iambic
3950,for thy records and what we see doth lie,iambic
3951,made more or less by thy continual haste,iambic
3952,this i do vow and this shall ever be,iambic
3953,i will be true despite thy scythe and thee,iambic
3954,if my dear love were but the child of state,iambic
3955,it might for fortunes bastard be unfatherd,iambic
3956,as subject to times love or to times hate,iambic
3957,weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gatherd,iambic
3958,no it was builded far from accident,iambic
3959,it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls,iambic
3960,under the blow of thralled discontent,iambic
3961,whereto the inviting time our fashion calls,iambic
3962,it fears not policy that heretic,iambic
3963,which works on leases of shortnumberd hours,iambic
3964,but all alone stands hugely politic,iambic
3965,that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers,iambic
3966,to this i witness call the fools of time,iambic
3967,which die for goodness who have lived for crime,iambic
3968,were t aught to me i bore the canopy,iambic
3969,with my extern the outward honouring,iambic
3970,or laid great bases for eternity,iambic
3971,which prove more short than waste or ruining,iambic
3972,have i not seen dwellers on form and favour,iambic
3973,lose all and more by paying too much rent,iambic
3974,for compound sweet forgoing simple savour,iambic
3975,pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent,iambic
3976,no let me be obsequious in thy heart,iambic
3977,and take thou my oblation poor but free,iambic
3978,which is not mixd with seconds knows no art,iambic
3979,but mutual render only me for thee,iambic
3980,hence thou subornd informer a true soul,iambic
3981,when most impeachd stands least in thy control,iambic
3982,o thou my lovely boy who in thy power,iambic
3983,dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour,iambic
3984,who hast by waning grown and therein showst,iambic
3985,thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst,iambic
3986,if nature sovereign mistress over wrack,iambic
3987,as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,iambic
3988,she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill,iambic
3989,may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill,iambic
3990,yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure,iambic
3991,she may detain but not still keep her treasure,iambic
3992,her audit though delayd answerd must be,iambic
3993,and her quietus is to render thee,iambic
3994,in the old age black was not counted fair,iambic
3995,or if it were it bore not beautys name,iambic
3996,but now is black beautys successive heir,iambic
3997,and beauty slanderd with a bastard shame,iambic
3998,for since each hand hath put on natures power,iambic
3999,fairing the foul with arts false borrowd face,iambic
4000,sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,iambic
4001,but is profaned if not lives in disgrace,iambic
4002,therefore my mistress brows are raven black,iambic
4003,her eyes so suited and they mourners seem,iambic
4004,at such who not born fair no beauty lack,iambic
4005,slandering creation with a false esteem,iambic
4006,yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,iambic
4007,that every tongue says beauty should look so,iambic
4008,how oft when thou my music music playst,iambic
4009,upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds,iambic
4010,with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst,iambic
4011,the wiry concord that mine ear confounds,iambic
4012,do i envy those jacks that nimble leap,iambic
4013,to kiss the tender inward of thy hand,iambic
4014,whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,iambic
4015,at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand,iambic
4016,to be so tickled they would change their state,iambic
4017,and situation with those dancing chips,iambic
4018,oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,iambic
4019,making dead wood more blest than living lips,iambic
4020,since saucy jacks so happy are in this,iambic
4021,give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss,iambic
4022,the expense of spirit in a waste of shame,iambic
4023,is lust in action and till action lust,iambic
4024,is perjured murderous bloody full of blame,iambic
4025,savage extreme rude cruel not to trust,iambic
4026,enjoyd no sooner but despised straight,iambic
4027,past reason hunted and no sooner had,iambic
4028,past reason hated as a swallowd bait,iambic
4029,on purpose laid to make the taker mad,iambic
4030,mad in pursuit and in possession so,iambic
4031,had having and in quest to have extreme,iambic
4032,a bliss in proof and proved a very woe,iambic
4033,before a joy proposed behind a dream,iambic
4034,all this the world well knows yet none knows well,iambic
4035,to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell,iambic
4036,my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun,iambic
4037,coral is far more red than her lips red,iambic
4038,if snow be white why then her breasts are dun,iambic
4039,if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head,iambic
4040,i have seen roses damaskd red and white,iambic
4041,but no such roses see i in her cheeks,iambic
4042,and in some perfumes is there more delight,iambic
4043,than in the breath that from my mistress reeks,iambic
4044,i love to hear her speak yet well i know,iambic
4045,that music hath a far more pleasing sound,iambic
4046,i grant i never saw a goddess go,iambic
4047,my mistress when she walks treads on the ground,iambic
4048,and yet by heaven i think my love as rare,iambic
4049,as any she belied with false compare,iambic
4050,thou art as tyrannous so as thou art,iambic
4051,as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel,iambic
4052,for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart,iambic
4053,thou art the fairest and most precious jewel,iambic
4054,yet in good faith some say that thee behold,iambic
4055,thy face hath not the power to make love groan,iambic
4056,to say they err i dare not be so bold,iambic
4057,although i swear it to myself alone,iambic
4058,and to be sure that is not false i swear,iambic
4059,a thousand groans but thinking on thy face,iambic
4060,one on anothers neck do witness bear,iambic
4061,thy black is fairest in my judgments place,iambic
4062,in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,iambic
4063,and thence this slander as i think proceeds,iambic
4064,thine eyes i love and they as pitying me,iambic
4065,knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,iambic
4066,have put on black and loving mourners be,iambic
4067,looking with pretty ruth upon my pain,iambic
4068,and truly not the morning sun of heaven,iambic
4069,better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,iambic
4070,nor that full star that ushers in the even,iambic
4071,doth half that glory to the sober west,iambic
4072,as those two mourning eyes become thy face,iambic
4073,o let it then as well beseem thy heart,iambic
4074,to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,iambic
4075,and suit thy pity like in every part,iambic
4076,then will i swear beauty herself is black,iambic
4077,and all they foul that thy complexion lack,iambic
4078,beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan,iambic
4079,for that deep wound it gives my friend and me,iambic
4080,ist not enough to torture me alone,iambic
4081,but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be,iambic
4082,me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,iambic
4083,and my next self thou harder hast engrossd,iambic
4084,of him myself and thee i am forsaken,iambic
4085,a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd,iambic
4086,prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward,iambic
4087,but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail,iambic
4088,whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard,iambic
4089,thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol,iambic
4090,and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee,iambic
4091,perforce am thine and all that is in me,iambic
4092,so now i have confessd that he is thine,iambic
4093,and i myself am mortgaged to thy will,iambic
4094,myself ill forfeit so that other mine,iambic
4095,thou wilt restore to be my comfort still,iambic
4096,but thou wilt not nor he will not be free,iambic
4097,for thou art covetous and he is kind,iambic
4098,he learnd but suretylike to write for me,iambic
4099,under that bond that him as fast doth bind,iambic
4100,the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,iambic
4101,thou usurer that putst forth all to use,iambic
4102,and sue a friend came debtor for my sake,iambic
4103,so him i lose through my unkind abuse,iambic
4104,him have i lost thou hast both him and me,iambic
4105,he pays the whole and yet am i not free,iambic
4106,whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will,iambic
4107,and will to boot and will in overplus,iambic
4108,more than enough am i that vex thee still,iambic
4109,to thy sweet will making addition thus,iambic
4110,wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,iambic
4111,not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine,iambic
4112,shall will in others seem right gracious,iambic
4113,and in my will no fair acceptance shine,iambic
4114,the sea all water yet receives rain still,iambic
4115,and in abundance addeth to his store,iambic
4116,so thou being rich in will add to thy will,iambic
4117,one will of mine to make thy large will more,iambic
4118,let no unkind no fair beseechers kill,iambic
4119,think all but one and me in that one will,iambic
4120,if thy soul cheque thee that i come so near,iambic
4121,swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will,iambic
4122,and will thy soul knows is admitted there,iambic
4123,thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil,iambic
4124,will will fulfil the treasure of thy love,iambic
4125,ay fill it full with wills and my will one,iambic
4126,in things of great receipt with ease we prove,iambic
4127,among a number one is reckond none,iambic
4128,then in the number let me pass untold,iambic
4129,though in thy stores account i one must be,iambic
4130,for nothing hold me so it please thee hold,iambic
4131,that nothing me a something sweet to thee,iambic
4132,make but my name thy love and love that still,iambic
4133,and then thou lovest me for my name is will,iambic
4134,thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes,iambic
4135,that they behold and see not what they see,iambic
4136,they know what beauty is see where it lies,iambic
4137,yet what the best is take the worst to be,iambic
4138,if eyes corrupt by overpartial looks,iambic
4139,be anchord in the bay where all men ride,iambic
4140,why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks,iambic
4141,whereto the judgment of my heart is tied,iambic
4142,why should my heart think that a several plot,iambic
4143,which my heart knows the wide worlds common place,iambic
4144,or mine eyes seeing this say this is not,iambic
4145,to put fair truth upon so foul a face,iambic
4146,in things right true my heart and eyes have erred,iambic
4147,and to this false plague are they now transferrd,iambic
4148,when my love swears that she is made of truth,iambic
4149,i do believe her though i know she lies,iambic
4150,that she might think me some untutord youth,iambic
4151,unlearned in the worlds false subtleties,iambic
4152,thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,iambic
4153,although she knows my days are past the best,iambic
4154,simply i credit her false speaking tongue,iambic
4155,on both sides thus is simple truth suppressd,iambic
4156,but wherefore says she not she is unjust,iambic
4157,and wherefore say not i that i am old,iambic
4158,o loves best habit is in seeming trust,iambic
4159,and age in love loves not to have years told,iambic
4160,therefore i lie with her and she with me,iambic
4161,and in our faults by lies we flatterd be,iambic
4162,o call not me to justify the wrong,iambic
4163,that thy unkindness lays upon my heart,iambic
4164,wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,iambic
4165,use power with power and slay me not by art,iambic
4166,tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight,iambic
4167,dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,iambic
4168,what needst thou wound with cunning when thy might,iambic
4169,is more than my oerpressd defense can bide,iambic
4170,let me excuse thee ah my love well knows,iambic
4171,her pretty looks have been mine enemies,iambic
4172,and therefore from my face she turns my foes,iambic
4173,that they elsewhere might dart their injuries,iambic
4174,yet do not so but since i am near slain,iambic
4175,kill me outright with looks and rid my pain,iambic
4176,be wise as thou art cruel do not press,iambic
4177,my tonguetied patience with too much disdain,iambic
4178,lest sorrow lend me words and words express,iambic
4179,the manner of my pitywanting pain,iambic
4180,if i might teach thee wit better it were,iambic
4181,though not to love yet love to tell me so,iambic
4182,as testy sick men when their deaths be near,iambic
4183,no news but health from their physicians know,iambic
4184,for if i should despair i should grow mad,iambic
4185,and in my madness might speak ill of thee,iambic
4186,now this illwresting world is grown so bad,iambic
4187,mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,iambic
4188,that i may not be so nor thou belied,iambic
4189,bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide,iambic
4190,in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes,iambic
4191,for they in thee a thousand errors note,iambic
4192,but tis my heart that loves what they despise,iambic
4193,who in despite of view is pleased to dote,iambic
4194,nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted,iambic
4195,nor tender feeling to base touches prone,iambic
4196,nor taste nor smell desire to be invited,iambic
4197,to any sensual feast with thee alone,iambic
4198,but my five wits nor my five senses can,iambic
4199,dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,iambic
4200,who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man,iambic
4201,thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be,iambic
4202,only my plague thus far i count my gain,iambic
4203,that she that makes me sin awards me pain,iambic
4204,love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,iambic
4205,hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving,iambic
4206,o but with mine compare thou thine own state,iambic
4207,and thou shalt find it merits not reproving,iambic
4208,or if it do not from those lips of thine,iambic
4209,that have profaned their scarlet ornaments,iambic
4210,and seald false bonds of love as oft as mine,iambic
4211,robbd others beds revenues of their rents,iambic
4212,be it lawful i love thee as thou lovest those,iambic
4213,whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,iambic
4214,root pity in thy heart that when it grows,iambic
4215,thy pity may deserve to pitied be,iambic
4216,if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,iambic
4217,by selfexample mayst thou be denied,iambic
4218,lo as a careful housewife runs to catch,iambic
4219,one of her featherd creatures broke away,iambic
4220,sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch,iambic
4221,in pursuit of the thing she would have stay,iambic
4222,whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,iambic
4223,cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,iambic
4224,to follow that which flies before her face,iambic
4225,not prizing her poor infants discontent,iambic
4226,so runnst thou after that which flies from thee,iambic
4227,whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind,iambic
4228,but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me,iambic
4229,and play the mothers part kiss me be kind,iambic
4230,so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will,iambic
4231,if thou turn back and my loud crying still,iambic
4232,two loves i have of comfort and despair,iambic
4233,which like two spirits do suggest me still,iambic
4234,the better angel is a man right fair,iambic
4235,the worser spirit a woman colourd ill,iambic
4236,to win me soon to hell my female evil,iambic
4237,tempteth my better angel from my side,iambic
4238,and would corrupt my saint to be a devil,iambic
4239,wooing his purity with her foul pride,iambic
4240,and whether that my angel be turnd fiend,iambic
4241,suspect i may but not directly tell,iambic
4242,but being both from me both to each friend,iambic
4243,i guess one angel in anothers hell,iambic
4244,yet this shall i neer know but live in doubt,iambic
4245,till my bad angel fire my good one out,iambic
4246,those lips that loves own hand did make,iambic
4247,breathed forth the sound that said i hate,iambic
4248,to me that languishd for her sake,iambic
4249,but when she saw my woeful state,iambic
4250,straight in her heart did mercy come,iambic
4251,chiding that tongue that ever sweet,iambic
4252,was used in giving gentle doom,iambic
4253,and taught it thus anew to greet,iambic
4254,i hate she alterd with an end,iambic
4255,that followd it as gentle day,iambic
4256,doth follow night who like a fiend,iambic
4257,from heaven to hell is flown away,iambic
4258,i hate from hate away she threw,iambic
4259,and saved my life saying not you,iambic
4260,poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,iambic
4261,these rebel powers that thee array,iambic
4262,why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,iambic
4263,painting thy outward walls so costly gay,iambic
4264,why so large cost having so short a lease,iambic
4265,dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend,iambic
4266,shall worms inheritors of this excess,iambic
4267,eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end,iambic
4268,then soul live thou upon thy servants loss,iambic
4269,and let that pine to aggravate thy store,iambic
4270,buy terms divine in selling hours of dross,iambic
4271,within be fed without be rich no more,iambic
4272,so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men,iambic
4273,and death once dead theres no more dying then,iambic
4274,my love is as a fever longing still,iambic
4275,for that which longer nurseth the disease,iambic
4276,feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,iambic
4277,the uncertain sickly appetite to please,iambic
4278,my reason the physician to my love,iambic
4279,angry that his prescriptions are not kept,iambic
4280,hath left me and i desperate now approve,iambic
4281,desire is death which physic did except,iambic
4282,past cure i am now reason is past care,iambic
4283,and franticmad with evermore unrest,iambic
4284,my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are,iambic
4285,at random from the truth vainly expressd,iambic
4286,for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,iambic
4287,who art as black as hell as dark as night,iambic
4288,o me what eyes hath love put in my head,iambic
4289,which have no correspondence with true sight,iambic
4290,or if they have where is my judgment fled,iambic
4291,that censures falsely what they see aright,iambic
4292,if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,iambic
4293,what means the world to say it is not so,iambic
4294,if it be not then love doth well denote,iambic
4295,loves eye is not so true as all mens no,iambic
4296,how can it o how can loves eye be true,iambic
4297,that is so vexd with watching and with tears,iambic
4298,no marvel then though i mistake my view,iambic
4299,the sun itself sees not till heaven clears,iambic
4300,o cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind,iambic
4301,lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find,iambic
4302,canst thou o cruel say i love thee not,iambic
4303,when i against myself with thee partake,iambic
4304,do i not think on thee when i forgot,iambic
4305,am of myself all tyrant for thy sake,iambic
4306,who hateth thee that i do call my friend,iambic
4307,on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon,iambic
4308,nay if thou lourst on me do i not spend,iambic
4309,revenge upon myself with present moan,iambic
4310,what merit do i in myself respect,iambic
4311,that is so proud thy service to despise,iambic
4312,when all my best doth worship thy defect,iambic
4313,commanded by the motion of thine eyes,iambic
4314,but love hate on for now i know thy mind,iambic
4315,those that can see thou lovest and i am blind,iambic
4316,o from what power hast thou this powerful might,iambic
4317,with insufficiency my heart to sway,iambic
4318,to make me give the lie to my true sight,iambic
4319,and swear that brightness doth not grace the day,iambic
4320,whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,iambic
4321,that in the very refuse of thy deeds,iambic
4322,there is such strength and warrantize of skill,iambic
4323,that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds,iambic
4324,who taught thee how to make me love thee more,iambic
4325,the more i hear and see just cause of hate,iambic
4326,o though i love what others do abhor,iambic
4327,with others thou shouldst not abhor my state,iambic
4328,if thy unworthiness raised love in me,iambic
4329,more worthy i to be beloved of thee,iambic
4330,love is too young to know what conscience is,iambic
4331,yet who knows not conscience is born of love,iambic
4332,then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,iambic
4333,lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove,iambic
4334,for thou betraying me i do betray,iambic
4335,my nobler part to my gross bodys treason,iambic
4336,my soul doth tell my body that he may,iambic
4337,triumph in love flesh stays no father reason,iambic
4338,but rising at thy name doth point out thee,iambic
4339,as his triumphant prize proud of this pride,iambic
4340,he is contented thy poor drudge to be,iambic
4341,to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side,iambic
4342,no want of conscience hold it that i call,iambic
4343,her love for whose dear love i rise and fall,iambic
4344,in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn,iambic
4345,but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,iambic
4346,in act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn,iambic
4347,in vowing new hate after new love bearing,iambic
4348,but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee,iambic
4349,when i break twenty i am perjured most,iambic
4350,for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,iambic
4351,and all my honest faith in thee is lost,iambic
4352,for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,iambic
4353,oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy,iambic
4354,and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,iambic
4355,or made them swear against the thing they see,iambic
4356,for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i,iambic
4357,to swear against the truth so foul a lie,iambic
4358,cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,iambic
4359,a maid of dians this advantage found,iambic
4360,and his lovekindling fire did quickly steep,iambic
4361,in a cold valleyfountain of that ground,iambic
4362,which borrowd from this holy fire of love,iambic
4363,a dateless lively heat still to endure,iambic
4364,and grew a seething bath which yet men prove,iambic
4365,against strange maladies a sovereign cure,iambic
4366,but at my mistress eye loves brand newfired,iambic
4367,the boy for trial needs would touch my breast,iambic
4368,i sick withal the help of bath desired,iambic
4369,and thither hied a sad distemperd guest,iambic
4370,but found no cure the bath for my help lies,iambic
4371,where cupid got new firemy mistress eyes,iambic
4372,the little lovegod lying once asleep,iambic
4373,laid by his side his heartinflaming brand,iambic
4374,whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep,iambic
4375,came tripping by but in her maiden hand,iambic
4376,the fairest votary took up that fire,iambic
4377,which many legions of true hearts had warmd,iambic
4378,and so the general of hot desire,iambic
4379,was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmd,iambic
4380,this brand she quenched in a cool well by,iambic
4381,which from loves fire took heat perpetual,iambic
4382,growing a bath and healthful remedy,iambic
4383,for men diseased but i my mistress thrall,iambic
4384,came there for cure and this by that i prove,iambic
4385,loves fire heats water water cools not love,iambic
4386,come to me and put thine sweet eyes,anapaest
4387,to put slander within my mind,anapaest
4388,of the old and bad trite stale kind,anapaest
4389,what false lines do impinge thy name,anapaest
4390,the well known lord and lady blare,anapaest
4391,such words i will not yea believe,anapaest
4392,since without gens how they deceive,anapaest
4393,the hot fire of this flames flambeau,anapaest
4394,will burn scurrilous page i know,anapaest
4395,then with glaive on this pole ill take,anapaest
4396,their head clean off for they names sake,anapaest
4397,i recall to our life when she came,anapaest
4398,and for long years few knew who she was,anapaest
4399,two decades and more still theres oerload,anapaest
4400,of mega bits and bytes thrown to us,anapaest
4401,and what a contradiction it is,anapaest
4402,no one has refrained from sharing views,anapaest
4403,and i oft feel ignorance is zen,anapaest
4404,but today it might drown us in doubt,anapaest
4405,time there was when it seemed our asset,anapaest
4406,such is shy maidens felicity,anapaest
4407,but mired with opinions dressed as lie,anapaest
4408,so enchanted was sun by queen sea,anapaest
4409,as he sat near some clouds high above,anapaest
4410,he began sliding down stealthily,anapaest
4411,till he touched the dark face of his love,anapaest
4412,then a third lover looked on the face,anapaest
4413,rosy heavens with deep purple lace,anapaest
4414,night embraced lovely sea sun was gone,anapaest
4415,such poor plight how can forever conceal,anapaest
4416,who will write future in black and white,anapaest
4417,this surveyed,anapaest
4418,in solitude,anapaest
4419,acquainted,anapaest
4420,i must look very deep in my soul,anapaest
4421,that will help me get close to my goal,anapaest
4422,clear i see as a child i was free,anapaest
4423,brought to church i was taught god to love,anapaest
4424,down a path that would lead to above,anapaest
4425,for my heart and my soul lived for god,anapaest
4426,knowing he was my staff and my rod,anapaest
4427,now my hate strongly started to burn,anapaest
4428,all this hate in me screamed set me free,anapaest
4429,i am saved by his grace every day,anapaest
4430,im at peace and my spirit is free,anapaest
4431,free to fly with these wings god gave me,anapaest
4432,i will dread octobers spell,anapaest
4433,it only comes but once a year,anapaest
4434,but mummys cell phone gets a tweet,anapaest
4435,she gets unraveled in the sheets,anapaest
4436,and from the gauze that trips her feet,anapaest
4437,ghouls in shadows want to play,anapaest
4438,does he stand a ghost of chance,anapaest
4439,to take her to the midnight dance,anapaest
4440,our cat has groomed her black coat sleek,anapaest
4441,then hops upon the fence to sneak,anapaest
4442,a peek into the living room,anapaest
4443,where dad weaves magic like a goon,anapaest
4444,embarrassed is a family clan,anapaest
4445,they toss his magic in the can,anapaest
4446,a wartnosed witch gets on her broom,anapaest
4447,but preteen feet cant fly or zoom,anapaest
4448,until she cleans her messy room,anapaest
4449,the bedrooms cleaned with spit and shine,anapaest
4450,while brother dares to take his time,anapaest
4451,he plans to fill his sisters bag,anapaest
4452,with tasty toads and wormy slime,anapaest
4453,i hide and dread the harvest moon,anapaest
4454,all hollows eve is coming soon,anapaest
4455,i thought id write some poetry,anapaest
4456,just for the fun that it would be,anapaest
4457,so i went to the web to see,anapaest
4458,what it said,anapaest
4459,about how to write poems just for me,anapaest
4460,i ran into words like iambic and tercet,anapaest
4461,and other ones that i had never met,anapaest
4462,there was even a thing called a quatrain,anapaest
4463,that confused and corrupted my brain,anapaest
4464,stanzas are neat if they get the right beat,anapaest
4465,with the meter which id no doubt delete,anapaest
4466,you also have tetrameter and pentameter,anapaest
4467,which are terms i dont think are neat,anapaest
4468,long ago i did write in rhyme,anapaest
4469,but just to friends who didnt mind,anapaest
4470,id write some limericks or lyrics to sing,anapaest
4471,that were not important,anapaest
4472,and didnt mean a thing,anapaest
4473,but as i write now and look into how,anapaest
4474,i find myself stymied by words to allow,anapaest
4475,i read such things as trochee,anapaest
4476,and anapest and even dactyl,anapaest
4477,they are words i just read,anapaest
4478,and dont really feel,anapaest
4479,a measure in feet,anapaest
4480,with stresses on heavy or light,anapaest
4481,and then they repeat,anapaest
4482,they do form the meter,anapaest
4483,which makes the poem complete,anapaest
4484,i may just give up and write more in prose,anapaest
4485,my friends will give thanks and id smell like a rose,anapaest
4486,but i do get such joy with the lines in a verse,anapaest
4487,which doesnt make sense,anapaest
4488,and just makes it worse,anapaest
4489,free verse would just boggle my mind,anapaest
4490,it really wont matter,anapaest
4491,what rules i would shatter,anapaest
4492,as long as i make the words rhyme,anapaest
4493,limerick gimmerick,anapaest
4494,jason of pendleton,anapaest
4495,tried doubledactyls while,anapaest
4496,fearing the worst,anapaest
4497,uhohspaghettio,anapaest
4498,theyre all bassackwards cuz,anapaest
4499,hes used to anapest,anapaest
4500,an old goat in a boat rowed off shore,anapaest
4501,he caught perch in his search and much more,anapaest
4502,theres trout in his coat,anapaest
4503,eau de fish was his scent evermore,anapaest
4504,how they laugh and they point as they whisper bout me,anapaest
4505,and they only can see what their shallow eyes see,anapaest
4506,though my surface is not picture perfect for show,anapaest
4507,how this heart bleeds with purpose they never could know,anapaest
4508,of the horrors and trials my soul has survived,anapaest
4509,of the hell and the fury that killed me alive,anapaest
4510,ive been stripped of my honor and burnt at the stake,anapaest
4511,made to live in a nightmare but could not awake,anapaest
4512,the atrocities bared on my face in display,anapaest
4513,oh they cause you to cringe as your eyes turn away,anapaest
4514,and the truth is my scars are much deeper than face,anapaest
4515,just a trace has been left of humanitys grace,anapaest
4516,as they came in the dead of the night whilst we slept,anapaest
4517,through the house down the hall they so silently crept,anapaest
4518,i was tied to a chair and with sickened disgust,anapaest
4519,made to watch as my daughters defiled with their lust,anapaest
4520,oh my sweet baby girls who i failed to protect,anapaest
4521,now your innocence lives in my heart where youre kept,anapaest
4522,as the flames and your screams took the last of my peace,anapaest
4523,melting skin joined my tears as your souls found release,anapaest
4524,fall the leaves of the forest tho death has yet passed,anapaest
4525,unto moonlit shadows within crypts hidden rot,anapaest
4526,oh but lo to the truth they are blind it is naught,anapaest
4527,theyre but fragmented feelings of love left aghast,anapaest
4528,from her heart they were torn bits he stabbed then forgot,anapaest
4529,the shadows cannot hide nor contain the scars wrought,anapaest
4530,left to wander until retribution is brought,anapaest
4531,as the sky bleeds to twilight the sweetest disease,anapaest
4532,as a warm breeze courts eros at twilights advance,anapaest
4533,till a feverish tango as all reason halts,anapaest
4534,as the world falls from focus in dizzying strides,anapaest
4535,should the moon cast its toxin on amorous souls,anapaest
4536,the subject at hand will be somewhat informal,anapaest
4537,i wonder each day what will be the new normal,anapaest
4538,to find some brand new locks growing out of my ear,anapaest
4539,and what of tomorrow morning when i awake,anapaest
4540,will i find a limb afflicted with a strange ache,anapaest
4541,will the pharmacy have some great cream or a pill,anapaest
4542,to assuage sudden change brought on by my ill,anapaest
4543,i have chosen to find humor rather than stress,anapaest
4544,to keep our lives routine will cost us more money,anapaest
4545,to the edge of horizons and harmonys light,anapaest
4546,comes warm smiles to be found on the face of our hearts,anapaest
4547,this rapture so vibrant from the wealth of loves eyes,anapaest
4548,was released and was felt when we cut through its veils,anapaest
4549,to invite a new world to be filled with lifes needs,anapaest
4550,and claim peace from the soul with the years to be shared,anapaest
4551,to welcome the mornings when the light rushes free,anapaest
4552,and hinges on eyelids come open to adore,anapaest
4553,the lovely jewels held in the life well treasure,anapaest
4554,as we move through the days with a blissful intent,anapaest
4555,when time becomes fleeting and the days become nights,anapaest
4556,unaware of the world and the time to have passed,anapaest
4557,to spend our emotions when love found us worthy,anapaest
4558,this payment to be made with the lips breathless kiss,anapaest
4559,i was lost as the night wrapped its ebony shades,anapaest
4560,round your lips like the petals on roses unfurled,anapaest
4561,left me hopeless to shun a temptation like this,anapaest
4562,though aware of the thorns and the danger they posed,anapaest
4563,so i reached for your love and i bled and i cried,anapaest
4564,as i danced through the stems of your past and your life,anapaest
4565,and was freed from my own hidden garden of pain,anapaest
4566,a poet was making such clatter,anapaest
4567,his friend ran to see whats the matter,anapaest
4568,or my poems cant be,anapaest
4569,in antiseptic pentameter,anapaest
4570,his friend laughed at all of the chatter,anapaest
4571,the other didnt grasp the matter,anapaest
4572,so your poems will be,anapaest
4573,in antipasto pentameter,anapaest
4574,my problem with glutens the matter,anapaest
4575,and why i must make so much clatter,anapaest
4576,im allergic you see,anapaest
4577,id get shakes and would be,anapaest
4578,writing in spastic pentameter,anapaest
4579,in a prayer anapestic,anapaest
4580,this form was to tick,anapaest
4581,tis the day after christmas the house is a mess,anapaest
4582,when will they restore order thats anyones guess,anapaest
4583,this familys sluggish and tired as can be,anapaest

4588,then a big pile of invoices for us awaits,anapaest
4589,we will pay them online now is no time to doze,anapaest
4590,then up from the recliner poor pooped dad arose,anapaest
4591,i can see them but often are blurs undefined,anapaest
4592,i can see them in beauty of lifes sweet ballet,anapaest
4593,every new day unfolds with its bright morning ray,anapaest
4594,in their river of insights where artistry streams,anapaest
4595,inspiration flows from them in glorious beams,anapaest
4596,gods most beautiful creatures of angels help me,anapaest
4597,angel love and directionsunup till sundown,anapaest
4598,angel love and directionsunup till sundown,anapaest
4599,i cannot say how poems come to be,anapaest
4600,they come into my mind amazingly,anapaest
4601,i cannot say how i hunt down my words,anapaest
4602,or then select a form to fit the theme,anapaest
4603,or count the syllables for metered flow,anapaest
4604,select the feet of two or more to show,anapaest
4605,that make the words behave or wildly prance,anapaest
4606,to then rewrite and add what i forgot,anapaest
4607,i cannot say how poems come to be,anapaest
4608,they come into my mind amazingly,anapaest
4609,is an awesome reserve of a pot filled with gold,anapaest
4610,in the form of gold coins to use up selfishly,anapaest
4611,theyll be wishes come true deep within to allot,anapaest
4612,like a resolute peace in each country on earth,anapaest

4848,and he played with a flair of beauty and motif,anapaest
4849,on a hill far away the notes softly and slow,anapaest
4850,without breaking his stride in the garden he played,anapaest
4851,i heard voices of angels in tune through it all,anapaest

4862,after making the trip to bar harbor in maine,anapaest
4863,we set off on excursions within that domain,anapaest
4864,in the midst of events aggravating arcane,anapaest
4865,we began at a loss,anapaest
4866,we embark on a most unpredictable task,anapaest
4867,touring cadillac mountain with fog as a mask,anapaest
4868,fifteen hundred feet high and sh shaking we ask,anapaest
4869,with alarm where's the bus,anapaest
4870,safely back at sea level we all need to chill,anapaest
4871,tell me who put the rest stop on top of a hill,anapaest
4872,giving vent to our steam we release it with skill,anapaest
4873,by creating a fuss,anapaest
4874,so we cuss as we scurry we snort and stampede,anapaest
4875,up the fifty two steps to attend to our need,anapaest
4876,on the zig zag descent rather tetchy still teed,anapaest
4877,we by chance run across,anapaest
4878,a botanical gem symbiotic we learn,anapaest
4879,a bizarre kind of growth some avoid with concern,anapaest
4880,is it algae or lichen a fungus or fern,anapaest
4881,a true whatzit for us,anapaest
4882,i see fanciful lace mid inherent decay,anapaest

4884,i see change as our mood now reverses dismay,anapaest
4885,it's an insight from moss,anapaest
4886,so i queried some poets who dance 'cross our pages,anapaest
4887,with such lightness and patterns and passion filled phrases,anapaest
4888,when your guidance is sought by one earnest and wide eyed,anapaest
4889,do you deign to reply just to prop up your self pride,anapaest
4890,do you tell her 'it's simple just read all you can,anapaest
4891,about me and my writing how fluid i am',anapaest
4892,or perhaps you're a mentor by nature and offer,anapaest
4893,to pry open the portals and share like an author,anapaest
4894,who reveals all his notes although mental they be,anapaest
4895,and takes pride in the craft of his new devotee,anapaest
4896,yes 'mong even the great ones we've heard of a few,anapaest
4897,magnanimity faded as rivalries grew,anapaest
4898,so our resolute neophyte meets with the names,anapaest
4899,those whose art she reads daily and counsel she claims,anapaest
4900,with the confidence born of a spirit secure,anapaest
4901,many veteran artists opine to be sure,anapaest
4902,some are eager to share of their passion for rhyme,anapaest
4903,and the metrical rhythm and pacing they find,anapaest
4904,so essential to verse in traditional form,anapaest
4905,with the internal metronome setting the norm,anapaest
4906,yes but what about consonance diction and sound,anapaest
4907,and the imagery seen in a free verse unbound,anapaest
4908,by the strictures and structures of metrical scheme,anapaest
4909,non traditional verse deserves no less esteem,anapaest
4910,in the end all agree that emotion's the key,anapaest
4911,and the soul of the poet must yearn to be free,anapaest
4912,to give access to mystery tragedy joy,anapaest
4913,be the uncensored voice that will sometimes annoy,anapaest
4914,let your passion be sovereign your unrivaled guide,anapaest
4915,you are artist at canvass palette at your side,anapaest
4916,twas the night before christmas when all thro' the house,anapaest
4917,not a creature was stirring not even a mouse,anapaest
4918,the stockings were hung by the chimney with care,anapaest
4919,in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there,anapaest
4920,the children were nestled all snug in their beds,anapaest
4921,while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,anapaest
4922,nd mamma in her 'kerchief and i in my cap,anapaest
4923,had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,anapaest
4924,when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,anapaest
4925,sprang from the bed to see what was the matter,anapaest
4926,away to the window i flew like a flash,anapaest
4927,tore open the shutters and threw up the sash,anapaest
4928,the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow,anapaest
4929,gave the lustre of mid day to objects below,anapaest
4930,when what to my wondering eyes should appear,anapaest
4931,but a miniature sleigh and eight tinny reindeer,anapaest
4932,with a little old driver so lively and quick,anapaest
4933,i knew in a moment it must be st nick,anapaest
4934,more rapid than eagles his coursers they came,anapaest
4935,and he whistled and shouted and called them by name,anapaest
4936,now dasher now dancer now prancer and vixen,anapaest
4937,on comet on cupid on on donner and blitzen,anapaest
4938,to the top of the porch to the top of the wall,anapaest
4939,now dash away dash away dash away all,anapaest
4940,as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,anapaest
4941,when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky,anapaest
4942,so up to the house top the coursers they flew,anapaest
4943,with the sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too,anapaest
4944,and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof,anapaest
4945,the prancing and pawing of each little hoof,anapaest
4946,as i drew in my head and was turning around,anapaest
4947,down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound,anapaest
4948,he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,anapaest
4949,and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot,anapaest
4950,a bundle of toys he had flung on his back,anapaest
4951,and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack,anapaest
4952,his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry,anapaest
4953,his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry,anapaest
4954,his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,anapaest
4955,and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow,anapaest
4956,the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,anapaest
4957,and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath,anapaest
4958,he had a broad face and a little round belly,anapaest
4959,that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly,anapaest
4960,he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf,anapaest
4961,and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself,anapaest
4962,a wink of his eye and a twist of his head,anapaest
4963,soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread,anapaest
4964,he spoke not a word but went straight to his work,anapaest
4965,and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk,anapaest
4966,and laying his finger aside of his nose,anapaest
4967,and giving a nod up the chimney he rose,anapaest
4968,he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle,anapaest
4969,and away they all flew like the down of a thistle,anapaest
4970,but i heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight,anapaest
4971,happy christmas to all and to all a good night,anapaest
4972,when the sparklers have sparked and the cannons have boomed,anapaest
4973,and the flags have been flown and the flowers have bloomed,anapaest
4974,when the coleslaw arrives and the meat has been grilled,anapaest
4975,and the children have played and the bellies are filled,anapaest
4976,when the families have left after long fond good byes,anapaest
4977,and the tables are cleared we sit back with a sigh,anapaest
4978,then we doze and digest with a satisfied smile,anapaest
4979,and with fondness remember the day for awhile,anapaest
4980,but perhaps in the midst of the party and fun,anapaest
4981,we've lost sight of the way that our freedom was won,anapaest
4982,let us never forget the great war that was fought,anapaest
4983,and the price for our freedom in blood dearly bought,anapaest
4984,for the wisest of men said that truth sets you free,anapaest
4985,and to let freedom ring truth was nailed to a tree,anapaest
4986,now that i tying thy glass mask tightly,anapaest
4987,may gaze thro' these faint smokes curling whitely,anapaest
4988,as thou pliest thy trade in this devil's smithy,anapaest
4989,which is the poison to poison her prithee,anapaest
4990,he is with her and they know that i know,anapaest
4991,where they are what they do they believe my tears flow,anapaest
4992,while they laugh laugh at me at me fled to the drear,anapaest
4993,empty church to pray god in for them i am here,anapaest
4994,grind away moisten and mash up thy paste,anapaest
4995,pound at thy powder i am not in haste,anapaest
4996,better sit thus and observe thy strange things,anapaest
4997,than go where men wait me and dance at the king's,anapaest
4998,that in the mortar you call it a gum,anapaest
4999,ah the brave tree whence such gold oozings come,anapaest
5000,and yonder soft phial the exquisite blue,anapaest
5001,sure to taste sweetly is that poison too,anapaest
5002,had i but all of them thee and thy treasures,anapaest
5003,what a wild crowd of invisible pleasures,anapaest
5004,to carry pure death in an earring a casket,anapaest
5005,a signet a fan mount a filigree basket,anapaest
5006,soon at the king's a mere lozenge to give,anapaest
5007,and pauline should have just thirty minutes to live,anapaest
5008,but to light a pastile and elise with her head,anapaest
5009,and her breast and her arms and her hands should drop dead,anapaest
5010,quick is it finished the colour's too grim,anapaest
5011,why not soft like the phial's enticing and dim,anapaest
5012,let it brighten her drink let her turn it and stir,anapaest
5013,and try it and taste ere she fix and prefer,anapaest
5014,what a drop she's not little no minion like me,anapaest
5015,that's why she ensnared him this never will free,anapaest
5016,the soul from those masculine eyes say no,anapaest
5017,to that pulse's magnificent come and go,anapaest
5018,for only last night as they whispered i brought,anapaest
5019,my own eyes to bear on her so that i thought,anapaest
5020,could i keep them one half minute fixed she would fall,anapaest
5021,shrivelled she fell not yet this does it all,anapaest
5022,not that i bid you spare her the pain,anapaest
5023,let death be felt and the proof remain,anapaest
5024,brand burn up bite into its grace,anapaest
5025,he is sure to remember her dying face,anapaest
5026,is it done take my mask off nay be not morose,anapaest
5027,it kills her and this prevents seeing it close,anapaest
5028,the delicate droplet my whole fortune's fee,anapaest
5029,if it hurts her beside can it ever hurt me,anapaest
5030,now take all my jewels gorge gold to your fill,anapaest
5031,you may kiss me old man on my mouth if you will,anapaest
5032,but brush this dust off me lest horror it brings,anapaest
5033,ere i know it next moment i dance at the king's,anapaest
5034,listen my children and you shall hear,anapaest
5035,of the midnight ride of paul revere,anapaest
5036,on the eighteenth of april in seventy five,anapaest
5037,hardly a man is now alive,anapaest
5038,who remembers that famous day and year,anapaest
5039,he said to his friend 'if the british march,anapaest
5040,by land or sea from the town to night,anapaest
5041,hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch,anapaest
5042,of the north church tower as a signal light,anapaest
5043,one if by land and two if by sea,anapaest
5044,and i on the opposite shore will be,anapaest
5045,ready to ride and spread the alarm,anapaest
5046,through every middlesex village and farm,anapaest
5047,for the country folk to be up and to arm',anapaest
5048,then he said 'good night' and with muffled oar,anapaest
5049,silently rowed to the charlestown shore,anapaest
5050,just as the moon rose over the bay,anapaest
5051,where swinging wide at her moorings lay,anapaest
5052,the somerset british man of war,anapaest
5053,a phantom ship with each mast and spar,anapaest
5054,across the moon like a prison bar,anapaest
5055,and a huge black hulk that was magnified,anapaest
5056,by its own reflection in the tide,anapaest
5057,meanwhile his friend through alley and street,anapaest
5058,wanders and watches with eager ears,anapaest
5059,till in the silence around him he hears,anapaest
5060,the muster of men at the barrack door,anapaest
5061,the sound of arms and the tramp of feet,anapaest
5062,and the measured tread of the grenadiers,anapaest
5063,marching down to their boats on the shore,anapaest
5064,then he climbed the tower of the old north church,anapaest
5065,by the wooden stairs with stealthy tread,anapaest
5066,to the belfry chamber overhead,anapaest
5067,and startled the pigeons from their perch,anapaest
5068,on the sombre rafters that round him made,anapaest
5069,masses and moving shapes of shade,anapaest
5070,by the trembling ladder steep and tall,anapaest
5071,to the highest window in the wall,anapaest
5072,where he paused to listen and look down,anapaest
5073,a moment on the roofs of the town,anapaest
5074,and the moonlight flowing over all,anapaest
5075,beneath in the churchyard lay the dead,anapaest
5076,in their night encampment on the hill,anapaest
5077,wrapped in silence so deep and still,anapaest
5078,that he could hear like a sentinel's tread,anapaest
5079,the watchful night wind as it went,anapaest
5080,creeping along from tent to tent,anapaest
5081,and seeming to whisper 'all is well',anapaest
5082,a moment only he feels the spell,anapaest
5083,of the place and the hour and the secret dread,anapaest
5084,of the lonely belfry and the dead,anapaest
5085,for suddenly all his thoughts are bent,anapaest
5086,on a shadowy something far away,anapaest
5087,where the river widens to meet the bay,anapaest
5088,a line of black that bends and floats,anapaest
5089,on the rising tide like a bridge of boats,anapaest
5090,meanwhile impatient to mount and ride,anapaest
5091,booted and spurred with a heavy stride,anapaest
5092,on the opposite shore walked paul revere,anapaest
5093,now he patted his horse's side,anapaest
5094,now gazed at the landscape far and near,anapaest
5095,then impetuous stamped the earth,anapaest
5096,and turned and tightened his saddle girth,anapaest
5097,but mostly he watched with eager search,anapaest
5098,the belfry tower of the old north church,anapaest
5099,as it rose above the graves on the hill,anapaest
5100,lonely and spectral and sombre and still,anapaest
5101,and lo as he looks on the belfry's height,anapaest
5102,a glimmer and then a gleam of light,anapaest
5103,he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns,anapaest
5104,but lingers and gazes till full on his sight,anapaest
5105,a second lamp in the belfry burns,anapaest
5106,a hurry of hoofs in a village street,anapaest
5107,a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark,anapaest
5108,and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark,anapaest
5109,struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet,anapaest
5110,that was all and yet through the gloom and the light,anapaest
5111,the fate of a nation was riding that night,anapaest
5112,and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight,anapaest
5113,kindled the land into flame with its heat,anapaest
5114,he has left the village and mounted the steep,anapaest
5115,and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep,anapaest
5116,is the mystic meeting the ocean tides,anapaest
5117,and under the alders that skirt its edge,anapaest
5118,now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge,anapaest
5119,is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides,anapaest
5120,listen my children and you shall hear,anapaest
5121,of the midnight ride of paul revere,anapaest
5122,on the eighteenth of april in seventy five,anapaest

5204,now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge,anapaest
5205,is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides,anapaest
5206,it was twelve by the village clock,anapaest
5207,when he crossed the bridge into medford town,anapaest
5208,he heard the crowing of the cock,anapaest
5209,and the barking of the farmer's dog,anapaest
5210,and felt the damp of the river fog,anapaest
5211,that rises after the sun goes down,anapaest
5212,it was one by the village clock,anapaest
5213,when he galloped into lexington,anapaest
5214,he saw the gilded weathercock,anapaest
5215,swim in the moonlight as he passed,anapaest
5216,and the meeting house windows blank and bare,anapaest
5217,gaze at him with a spectral glare,anapaest
5218,as if they already stood aghast,anapaest
5219,at the bloody work they would look upon,anapaest
5220,it was two by the village clock,anapaest
5221,when he came to the bridge in concord town,anapaest
5222,he heard the bleating of the flock,anapaest
5223,and the twitter of birds among the trees,anapaest
5224,and felt the breath of the morning breeze,anapaest
5225,blowing over the meadows brown,anapaest
5226,and one was safe and asleep in his bed,anapaest
5227,who at the bridge would be first to fall,anapaest
5228,who that day would be lying dead,anapaest
5229,pierced by a british musket ball,anapaest
5230,you know the rest in the books you have read,anapaest
5231,how the british regulars fired and fled,anapaest
5232,how the farmers gave them ball for ball,anapaest
5233,from behind each fence and farm yard wall,anapaest
5234,chasing the red coats down the lane,anapaest
5235,then crossing the fields to emerge again,anapaest
5236,under the trees at the turn of the road,anapaest
5237,and only pausing to fire and load,anapaest
5238,so through the night rode paul revere,anapaest
5239,and so through the night went his cry of alarm,anapaest
5240,to every middlesex village and farm,anapaest
5241,a cry of defiance and not of fear,anapaest
5242,a voice in the darkness a knock at the door,anapaest
5243,and a word that shall echo forevermore,anapaest
5244,for borne on the night wind of the past,anapaest
5245,through all our history to the last,anapaest
5246,in the hour of darkness and peril and need,anapaest
5247,the people will waken and listen to hear,anapaest
5248,the hurrying hoof beats of that steed,anapaest
5249,and the midnight message of paul revere,anapaest
5250,does it matter losing your legs,anapaest
5251,for people will always be kind,anapaest
5252,and you need not show that you mind,anapaest
5253,to gobble their muffins and eggs,anapaest
5254,does it matter losing your sight,anapaest
5255,there's such splendid work for the blind,anapaest
5256,and people will always be kind,anapaest
5257,as you sit on the terrace remembering,anapaest
5258,and turning your face to the light,anapaest
5259,do they matter those dreams from the pit,anapaest
5260,you can drink and forget and be glad,anapaest
5261,and people won't say that you're mad,anapaest
5262,for they'll know you've fought for your country,anapaest
5263,and no one will worry a bit,anapaest
5264,o rose thou art sick,anapaest
5265,the invisible worm,anapaest
5266,that flies in the night,anapaest
5267,in the howling storm,anapaest
5268,has found out thy bed,anapaest
5269,of crimson joy,anapaest
5270,and his dark secret love,anapaest
5271,does thy life destroy,anapaest
5272,the assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,anapaest
5273,and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold,anapaest
5274,and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,anapaest
5275,when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee,anapaest
5276,like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,anapaest
5277,that host with their banners at sunset were seen,anapaest
5278,like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,anapaest
5279,that host on the morrow lay withered and strown,anapaest
5280,for the angel of death spread his wings on the blast,anapaest
5281,and breathed in the face of the foe as he passed,anapaest
5282,and the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,anapaest
5283,and their hearts but once heaved and for ever grew still,anapaest
5284,and there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,anapaest
5285,but through it there rolled not the breath of his pride,anapaest
5286,and the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,anapaest
5287,and cold as the spray of the rock beating surf,anapaest
5288,and there lay the rider distorted and pale,anapaest
5289,with the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail,anapaest
5290,and the tents were all silent the banners alone,anapaest
5291,the lances unlifted the trumpet unblown,anapaest
5292,autumn is wearing her bright golden crown,anapaest
5293,for this morning shes coming to visit our town,anapaest
5294,and wind her best friend will be joining her too,anapaest
5295,will they have a nice day and just what will they do,anapaest
5296,shell be changing the colours of leaves on our trees,anapaest
5297,and wind likes to tease with his cold playful breeze,anapaest
5298,as the leaves tumble down in a pile on the ground,anapaest
5299,he will take a deep breath and blow them around,anapaest
5300,they'll both knock down conkers for children to find,anapaest
5301,but the nuts arent just there for the good of mankind,anapaest
5302,the squirrels like nuts and theyll store them away,anapaest
5303,but then out they will come on those cold wintry days,anapaest
5304,so what do you think that the two friends might eat,anapaest
5305,what sorts of things would be good for a treat,anapaest
5306,there are sweet tasting berries and fruits of all kinds,anapaest
5307,which are wonderful treats for the two friends to find,anapaest
5308,they will chase over hills and along by the river,anapaest
5309,winds cold wintry breath may well cause us to shiver,anapaest
5310,the swallows will see them and say their goodbye,anapaest
5311,calling see you next year as they fly through the sky,anapaest
5312,with the sun going down theres no time left to play,anapaest
5313,but the two friends have had such a marvellous day,anapaest
5314,when you look all around at this colourful scene,anapaest
5315,you will see very clearly where these friends have been,anapaest
5316,the tiger stretches limb by limb,anapaest
5317,he views his world through sleepy eyes,anapaest
5318,and wonders what his day will bring,anapaest
5319,he does these things and so do i,anapaest
5320,the bear sets forth to hunt for food,anapaest
5321,and rambles under cloudy skies,anapaest
5322,he ponders what hell eat today,anapaest
5323,he looks for food and so do i,anapaest
5324,all creatures teach their young to hunt,anapaest
5325,and watch for danger lest they die,anapaest
5326,the parents teach the skills of life,anapaest
5327,their young learn these and so do i,anapaest
5328,the creatures of the day will seek,anapaest
5329,a place to sleep thats warm and dry,anapaest
5330,a safe abode thats far from harm,anapaest
5331,they drift to sleep and so do i,anapaest
5332,the bull in the meadow was bellowing hard,anapaest
5333,with a bawling and blustering blare,anapaest
5334,but the cows thought the bull was just showing off,anapaest
5335,and continued to graze without care,anapaest
5336,his shouting his screaming his clamorous cry,anapaest
5337,continued by day and by night,anapaest
5338,his vociferous roaring soon got on their nerves,anapaest
5339,whilst the mice and the birds fled in fright,anapaest
5340,the farmer then noticed the terrible noise,anapaest
5341,and he called in the vet to the scene,anapaest
5342,the vet scratched his head and only could say,anapaest
5343,its the noisiest bull that ive seen,anapaest
5344,i remember he lived at the farm up the road,anapaest
5345,and he had a particular friend,anapaest
5346,i suggest that you buy her to go with your herd,anapaest
5347,and im sure that his roaring will end,anapaest
5348,so next week a new cow arrived in their field,anapaest
5349,shed been bought from the neighbouring farm,anapaest
5350,shed endearing brown eyes and a beautiful face,anapaest

5416,where is the thatch roofed village the home of acadian farmers,dactyl
5417,men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,dactyl

5426,list to a tale of love in acadie home of the happy,dactyl
5427,in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas,dactyl
5428,distant secluded still the little village of grand pr,dactyl
5429,lay in the fruitful valley vast meadows stretched to the eastward,dactyl
5430,giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number,dactyl
5431,dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,dactyl
5432,shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood gates,dactyl
5433,opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows,dactyl
5434,west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields,dactyl
5435,spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain and away to the northward,dactyl
5436,blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains,dactyl
5437,sea fogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic,dactyl
5438,looked on the happy valley but ne'er from their station descended,dactyl
5439,there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village,dactyl
5440,strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of hemlock,dactyl
5441,such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries,dactyl
5442,thatched were the roofs with dormer windows and gables projecting,dactyl
5443,over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway,dactyl
5444,there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset,dactyl
5445,lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,dactyl
5446,matrons and maidens sat in snow white caps and in kirtles,dactyl
5447,scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden,dactyl
5448,flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors,dactyl
5449,mingled their sounds with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens,dactyl
5450,solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children,dactyl
5451,paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them,dactyl
5452,reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens,dactyl
5453,hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome,dactyl
5454,then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank,dactyl
5455,down to his rest and twilight prevailed anon from the belfry,dactyl
5456,softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village,dactyl
5457,columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending,dactyl
5458,rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment,dactyl
5459,thus dwelt together in love these simple acadian farmers,dactyl
5460,dwelt in the love of god and of man alike were they free from,dactyl
5461,fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics,dactyl
5462,neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows,dactyl
5463,but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners,dactyl
5464,there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance,dactyl
5465,somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas,dactyl
5466,benedict bellefontaine the wealthiest farmer of grand pr,dactyl
5467,dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household,dactyl
5468,gentle evangeline lived his child and the pride of the village,dactyl
5469,stalwart and stately in form was the man of seventy winters,dactyl
5470,hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes,dactyl
5471,white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak leaves,dactyl
5472,fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers,dactyl
5473,black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,dactyl
5474,black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses,dactyl
5475,sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows,dactyl
5476,when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide,dactyl
5477,flagons of home brewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden,dactyl
5478,fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret,dactyl
5479,sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop,dactyl
5480,sprinkles the congregation and scatters blessings upon them,dactyl
5481,down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal,dactyl
5482,wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the ear rings,dactyl
5483,brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom,dactyl
5484,handed down from mother to child through long generations,dactyl
5485,but a celestial brightnessa more ethereal beauty,dactyl
5486,shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession,dactyl
5487,homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her,dactyl
5488,when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music,dactyl
5489,firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer,dactyl
5490,stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady,dactyl
5491,sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it,dactyl
5492,rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath,dactyl
5493,led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow,dactyl
5494,under the sycamore tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,dactyl
5495,such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,dactyl
5496,built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary,dactyl
5497,farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its moss grown,dactyl
5498,bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses,dactyl
5499,shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard,dactyl
5500,there stood the broad wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows,dactyl
5501,there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio,dactyl
5502,strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame,dactyl
5503,voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter,dactyl
5504,bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village in each one,dactyl
5505,far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase,dactyl
5506,under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft,dactyl
5507,there too the dove cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates,dactyl
5508,murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes,dactyl
5509,numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation,dactyl
5510,thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grand pr,dactyl
5511,lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household,dactyl
5512,many a youth as he knelt in church and opened his missal,dactyl
5513,fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion,dactyl
5514,happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment,dactyl
5515,many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended,dactyl
5516,and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,dactyl
5517,knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron,dactyl
5518,or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village,dactyl
5519,bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered,dactyl
5520,hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music,dactyl
5521,but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome,dactyl
5522,gabriel lajeunesse the son of basil the blacksmith,dactyl
5523,who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men,dactyl
5524,for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations,dactyl
5525,has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people,dactyl
5526,basil was benedict's friend their children from earliest childhood,dactyl
5527,grew up together as brother and sister and father felician,dactyl
5528,priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters,dactyl
5529,out of the self same book with the hymns of the church and the plain song,dactyl
5530,but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed,dactyl
5531,swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith,dactyl
5532,there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him,dactyl
5533,take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,dactyl
5534,nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cart wheel,dactyl
5535,lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders,dactyl
5536,oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness,dactyl
5537,bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice,dactyl
5538,warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,dactyl
5539,and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes,dactyl
5540,merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel,dactyl
5541,oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle,dactyl
5542,down the hillside bounding they glided away o'er the meadow,dactyl
5543,oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,dactyl
5544,seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow,dactyl
5545,brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings,dactyl
5546,lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow,dactyl
5547,thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children,dactyl
5548,he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning,dactyl
5549,gladdened the earth with its light and ripened thought into action,dactyl
5550,she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman,dactyl
5551,sunshine of saint eulalie' was she called for that was the sunshine,dactyl
5552,which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples,dactyl
5553,she too would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,dactyl
5554,filling it with love and the ruddy faces of children,dactyl
5555,now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer,dactyl
5556,and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters,dactyl
5557,birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the ice bound,dactyl
5558,desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands,dactyl
5559,harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september,dactyl
5560,wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel,dactyl
5561,all the signs foretold a winter long and inclement,dactyl
5562,bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey,dactyl
5563,till the hives overflowed and the indian hunters asserted,dactyl
5564,cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes,dactyl
5565,such was the advent of autumn then followed that beautiful season,dactyl
5566,called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all saints,dactyl
5567,filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape,dactyl
5568,lay as if new created in all the freshness of childhood,dactyl
5569,peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean,dactyl
5570,was for a moment consoled all sounds were in harmony blended,dactyl
5571,voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farm yards,dactyl
5572,whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons,dactyl
5573,all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun,dactyl
5574,looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him,dactyl
5575,while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,dactyl
5576,bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest,dactyl
5577,flashed like the plane tree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels,dactyl
5578,now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness,dactyl
5579,day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending,dactyl
5580,brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead,dactyl
5581,pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other,dactyl
5582,and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening,dactyl
5583,foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer,dactyl
5584,proud of her snow white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar,dactyl
5585,quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection,dactyl
5586,then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,dactyl
5587,where was their favorite pasture behind them followed the watch dog,dactyl
5588,patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct,dactyl
5589,walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly,dactyl
5590,waving his bushy tail and urging forward the stragglers,dactyl
5591,regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector,dactyl
5592,when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled,dactyl
5593,late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes,dactyl
5594,laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor,dactyl
5595,cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,dactyl
5596,while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,dactyl
5597,painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson,dactyl
5598,nodded in bright array like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms,dactyl
5599,patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders,dactyl
5600,unto the milkmaid's hand whilst loud and in regular cadence,dactyl
5601,into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended,dactyl
5602,lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm yard,dactyl
5603,echoed back by the barns anon they sank into stillness,dactyl
5604,heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barn doors,dactyl
5605,rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent,dactyl
5606,in doors warm by the wide mouthed fireplace idly the farmer,dactyl
5607,sat in his elbow chair and watched how the flames and the smoke wreaths,dactyl
5608,struggled together like foes in a burning city behind him,dactyl
5609,nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic,dactyl
5610,darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness,dactyl
5611,faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm chair,dactyl
5612,laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser,dactyl
5613,caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine,dactyl
5614,fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas,dactyl
5615,such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him,dactyl
5616,sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards,dactyl
5617,close at her father's side was the gentle evangeline seated,dactyl
5618,spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her,dactyl
5619,silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle,dactyl
5620,while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe,dactyl
5621,followed the old man's song and united the fragments together,dactyl
5622,as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,dactyl
5623,footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar,dactyl
5624,so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked,dactyl
5625,thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted,dactyl
5626,sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges,dactyl
5627,benedict knew by the hob nailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith,dactyl
5628,and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him,dactyl
5629,welcome' the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold,dactyl
5630,welcome basil my friend come take thy place on the settle,dactyl
5631,close by the chimney side which is always empty without thee,dactyl
5632,take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco,dactyl
5633,never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling,dactyl
5634,smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams,dactyl
5635,round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes',dactyl
5636,then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith,dactyl
5637,taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside,dactyl
5638,benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad,dactyl
5639,ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with,dactyl
5640,gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them,dactyl
5641,happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe',dactyl
5642,pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him,dactyl
5643,and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued,dactyl
5644,four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors,dactyl
5645,ride in the gaspereau's mouth with their cannon pointed against us,dactyl
5646,what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded,dactyl
5647,on the morrow to meet in the church where his majesty's mandate,dactyl
5648,will be proclaimed as law in the land alas in the mean time,dactyl
5649,many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people',dactyl
5650,then made answer the farmer 'perhaps some friendlier purpose,dactyl
5651,brings these ships to our shores perhaps the harvests in england,dactyl
5652,by untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,dactyl
5653,and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children',dactyl
5654,not so thinketh the folk in the village' said warmly the blacksmith,dactyl
5655,shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued,dactyl
5656,louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sjour nor port royal,dactyl
5657,many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts,dactyl
5658,waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to morrow,dactyl
5659,arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds,dactyl
5660,nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower',dactyl
5661,then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer,dactyl
5662,safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,dactyl
5663,safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean,dactyl
5664,than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemy's cannon,dactyl
5665,fear no evil my friend and to night may no shadow of sorrow,dactyl
5666,fall on this house and earth for this is the night of the contract,dactyl
5667,built are the house and the barn the merry lads of the village,dactyl
5668,strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them,dactyl
5669,filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth,dactyl
5670,ren leblanc will be here anon with his papers and ink horn,dactyl
5671,shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children',dactyl
5672,as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's,dactyl
5673,blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,dactyl
5674,and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered,dactyl
5675,bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean,dactyl
5676,bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public,dactyl
5677,shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung,dactyl
5678,over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows,dactyl
5679,sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal,dactyl
5680,father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred,dactyl
5681,children's children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick,dactyl
5682,four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,dactyl
5683,suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english,dactyl
5684,now though warier grown without all guile or suspicion,dactyl
5685,ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike,dactyl
5686,he was beloved by all and most of all by the children,dactyl
5687,for he told them tales of the loup garou in the forest,dactyl
5688,and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,dactyl
5689,and of the white ltiche the ghost of a child who unchristened,dactyl
5690,died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children,dactyl
5691,and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,dactyl
5692,and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,dactyl
5693,and of the marvellous powers of four leaved clover and horseshoes,dactyl
5694,with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village,dactyl
5695,then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith,dactyl
5696,knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand,dactyl
5697,father leblanc' he exclaimed 'thou hast heard the talk in the village,dactyl
5698,and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand',dactyl
5699,then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,dactyl
5700,gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser,dactyl
5701,and what their errand may be i know not better than others,dactyl
5702,yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention,dactyl
5703,brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us',dactyl
5704,god's name' shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith,dactyl
5705,must we in all things look for the how and the why and the where fore,dactyl
5706,daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest',dactyl
5707,but without heeding his warmth continued the notary public,dactyl
5708,man is unjust but god is just and finally justice,dactyl
5709,triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me,dactyl
5710,when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal',dactyl
5711,this was the old man's favorite tale and he loved to repeat it,dactyl
5712,when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them,dactyl
5713,once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember,dactyl
5714,raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice,dactyl
5715,stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand,dactyl
5716,and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided,dactyl
5717,over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people,dactyl
5718,even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,dactyl
5719,having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them,dactyl
5720,but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted,dactyl
5721,might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty,dactyl
5722,ruled with an iron rod then it chanced in a nobleman's palace,dactyl
5723,that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion,dactyl
5724,fell on an orphan girl who lived as a maid in the household,dactyl
5725,she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,dactyl
5726,patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice,dactyl
5727,as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,dactyl
5728,lo o'er the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder,dactyl
5729,smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand,dactyl
5730,down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,dactyl
5731,and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,dactyl
5732,into whose clay built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven',dactyl
5733,silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith,dactyl
5734,stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language,dactyl
5735,all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors,dactyl
5736,freeze in fantastic shapes on the window panes in the winter,dactyl
5737,then evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,dactyl
5738,filled till it overflowed the pewter tankard with home brewed,dactyl
5739,nut brown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grand pr,dactyl
5740,while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and ink horn,dactyl
5741,wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,dactyl
5742,naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle,dactyl
5743,orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed,dactyl
5744,and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin,dactyl
5745,then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table,dactyl
5746,three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver,dactyl
5747,and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,dactyl
5748,lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare,dactyl
5749,wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed,dactyl
5750,while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,dactyl
5751,till evangeline brought the draught board out of its corner,dactyl
5752,soon was the game begun in friendly contention the old men,dactyl
5753,laughed at each lucky hit or unsuccessful manuvre,dactyl
5754,laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the king row,dactyl
5755,meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,dactyl
5756,sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise,dactyl
5757,over the pallid sea and the silvery mists of the meadows,dactyl
5758,silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven,dactyl
5759,blossomed the lovely stars the forget me nots of the angels,dactyl
5760,thus was the evening passed anon the bell from the belfry,dactyl
5761,rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway,dactyl
5762,rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household,dactyl
5763,many a farewell word and sweet good night on the door step,dactyl
5764,lingered long in evangeline's heart and filled it with gladness,dactyl
5765,carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth stone,dactyl
5766,and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer,dactyl
5767,soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed,dactyl
5768,up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,dactyl
5769,lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden,dactyl
5770,silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber,dactyl
5771,simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes press,dactyl
5772,ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded,dactyl
5773,linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven,dactyl
5774,this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,dactyl
5775,better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife,dactyl
5776,soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight,dactyl
5777,streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden,dactyl
5778,swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean,dactyl
5779,ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with,dactyl
5780,naked snow white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber,dactyl
5781,little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard,dactyl
5782,waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow,dactyl
5783,yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness,dactyl
5784,passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight,dactyl
5785,flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment,dactyl
5786,and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass,dactyl
5787,forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps,dactyl
5788,as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar,dactyl
5789,pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grand pr,dactyl
5790,pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas,dactyl
5791,where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor,dactyl
5792,life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor,dactyl
5793,knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning,dactyl
5794,now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets,dactyl
5795,came in their holiday dresses the blithe acadian peasants,dactyl
5796,many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk,dactyl
5797,made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows,dactyl
5798,where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,dactyl
5799,group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway,dactyl
5800,long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced,dactyl
5801,thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors,dactyl
5802,sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together,dactyl
5803,every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted,dactyl
5804,for with this simple people who lived like brothers together,dactyl
5805,all things were held in common and what one had was another's,dactyl
5806,yet under benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant,dactyl
5807,for evangeline stood among the guests of her father,dactyl
5808,bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness,dactyl
5809,fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it,dactyl
5810,under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard,dactyl
5811,stript of its golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal,dactyl
5812,there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated,dactyl
5813,there good benedict sat and sturdy basil the blacksmith,dactyl
5814,not far withdrawn from these by the cider press and the beehives,dactyl
5815,michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats,dactyl
5816,shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow white,dactyl
5817,hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler,dactyl
5818,glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers,dactyl
5819,gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,dactyl
5820,tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunquerque,dactyl
5821,and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music,dactyl
5822,merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances,dactyl
5823,under the orchard trees and down the path to the meadows,dactyl
5824,old folk and young together and children mingled among them,dactyl
5825,fairest of all the maids was evangeline benedict's daughter,dactyl
5826,noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith,dactyl
5827,so passed the morning away and lo with a summons sonorous,dactyl
5828,sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat,dactyl
5829,thronged erelong was the church with men without in the churchyard,dactyl
5830,waited the women they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones,dactyl
5831,garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest,dactyl
5832,then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them,dactyl
5833,entered the sacred portal with loud and dissonant clangor,dactyl
5834,echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,dactyl
5835,echoed a moment only and slowly the ponderous portal,dactyl
5836,closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers,dactyl
5837,then uprose their commander and spake from the steps of the altar,dactyl
5838,holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission,dactyl
5839,you are convened this day' he said 'by his majesty's orders,dactyl
5840,clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness,dactyl
5841,let your own hearts reply to my natural make and my temper,dactyl
5842,painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous,dactyl
5843,yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch,dactyl
5844,namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds,dactyl
5845,forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province,dactyl
5846,be transported to other lands god grant you may dwell there,dactyl
5847,ever as faithful subjects a happy and peaceable people,dactyl
5848,prisoners now i declare you for such is his majesty's pleasure',dactyl
5849,as when the air is serene in sultry solstice of summer,dactyl
5850,suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones,dactyl
5851,beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows,dactyl
5852,hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs,dactyl
5853,bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures,dactyl
5854,so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker,dactyl
5855,silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose,dactyl
5856,louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,dactyl
5857,and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway,dactyl
5858,vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations,dactyl
5859,rang through the house of prayer and high o'er the heads of the others,dactyl
5860,rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith,dactyl
5861,as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows,dactyl
5862,flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted,dactyl
5863,down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance,dactyl
5864,death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests',dactyl
5865,more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier,dactyl
5866,smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement,dactyl
5867,in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,dactyl
5868,lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician,dactyl
5869,entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar,dactyl
5870,raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence,dactyl
5871,all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people,dactyl
5872,deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful,dactyl
5873,spake he as after the tocsin's alarum distinctly the clock strikes,dactyl
5874,what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you,dactyl
5875,forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you,dactyl
5876,not in word alone but in deed to love one another,dactyl
5877,is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations,dactyl
5878,have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness,dactyl
5879,this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it,dactyl
5880,thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred,dactyl
5881,lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you,dactyl
5882,see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion,dactyl
5883,hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them,dactyl
5884,let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,dactyl
5885,let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them',dactyl
5886,few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people,dactyl
5887,sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,dactyl
5888,while they repeated his prayer and said 'o father forgive them',dactyl
5889,then came the evening service the tapers gleamed from the altar,dactyl
5890,fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded,dactyl
5891,not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria,dactyl
5892,sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated,dactyl
5893,rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven,dactyl
5894,meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides,dactyl
5895,wandered wailing from house to house the women and children,dactyl
5896,long at her father's door evangeline stood with her right hand,dactyl
5897,shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending,dactyl
5898,lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each,dactyl
5899,peasant's cottage with golden thatch and emblazoned its windows,dactyl
5900,long within had been spread the snow white cloth on the table,dactyl
5901,there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wild flowers,dactyl
5902,there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy,dactyl
5903,and at the head of the board the great arm chair of the farmer,dactyl
5904,thus did evangeline wait at her father's door as the sunset,dactyl
5905,threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows,dactyl
5906,ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,dactyl
5907,and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,dactyl
5908,charity meekness love and hope and forgiveness and patience,dactyl
5909,then all forgetful of self she wandered into the village,dactyl
5910,cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,dactyl
5911,as o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,dactyl
5912,urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children,dactyl
5913,down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors,dactyl
5914,veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai,dactyl
5915,sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded,dactyl
5916,meanwhile amid the gloom by the church evangeline lingered,dactyl
5917,all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows,dactyl
5918,stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion,dactyl
5919,gabriel' cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer,dactyl
5920,came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living,dactyl
5921,slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father,dactyl
5922,smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board was the supper untasted,dactyl
5923,empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror,dactyl
5924,sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber,dactyl
5925,in the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall,dactyl
5926,loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore tree by the window,dactyl
5927,keenly the lightning flashed and governed the voice of the echoing thunder,dactyl
5928,told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created,dactyl
5929,then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven,dactyl
5930,soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning,dactyl
5931,four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day,dactyl
5932,cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse,dactyl
5933,soon o'er the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession,dactyl
5934,came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women,dactyl
5935,driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea shore,dactyl
5936,pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,dactyl
5937,ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland,dactyl
5938,close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen,dactyl
5939,while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings,dactyl
5940,thus to the gaspereau's mouth they hurried and there on the sea beach,dactyl
5941,piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants,dactyl
5942,all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply,dactyl
5943,all day long the wains came laboring down from the village,dactyl
5944,late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting,dactyl
5945,echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard,dactyl
5946,thither the women and children thronged on a sudden the church doors,dactyl
5947,opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession,dactyl
5948,followed the long imprisoned but patient acadian farmers,dactyl
5949,even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country,dactyl
5950,sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,dactyl
5951,so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended,dactyl
5952,down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters,dactyl
5953,foremost the young men came and raising together their voices,dactyl
5954,sang with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions,dactyl
5955,sacred heart of the saviour o inexhaustible fountain,dactyl
5956,fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience',dactyl
5957,then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside,dactyl
5958,joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them,dactyl
5959,mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed,dactyl
5960,half way down to the shore evangeline waited in silence,dactyl
5961,not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction,dactyl
5962,calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her,dactyl
5963,and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion,dactyl
5964,tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him,dactyl
5965,clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered,dactyl
5966,gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another,dactyl
5967,nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen',dactyl
5968,smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father,dactyl
5969,saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect,dactyl
5970,gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep,dactyl
5971,heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom,dactyl
5972,but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him,dactyl
5973,speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not,dactyl
5974,thus to the gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession,dactyl
5975,there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking,dactyl
5976,busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion,dactyl
5977,wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children,dactyl
5978,left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties,dactyl
5979,so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried,dactyl
5980,while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father,dactyl
5981,half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight,dactyl
5982,deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean,dactyl
5983,fled away from the shore and left the line of the sand beach,dactyl
5984,covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery sea weed,dactyl
5985,farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,dactyl
5986,like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle,dactyl
5987,all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them,dactyl
5988,lay encamped for the night the houseless acadian farmers,dactyl
5989,back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,dactyl
5990,dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving,dactyl
5991,inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors,dactyl
5992,then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures,dactyl
5993,sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders,dactyl
5994,lowing they waited and long at the well known bars of the farm yard,dactyl
5995,waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milk maid,dactyl
5996,silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded,dactyl
5997,rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows,dactyl
5998,but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,dactyl
5999,built of the drift wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest,dactyl
6000,round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,dactyl
6001,voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children,dactyl
6002,onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish,dactyl
6003,wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering,dactyl
6004,like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea shore,dactyl
6005,thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father,dactyl
6006,and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,dactyl
6007,haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion,dactyl
6008,e'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken,dactyl
6009,vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,dactyl
6010,vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not,dactyl
6011,but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight,dactyl
6012,benedicite' murmured the priest in tones of compassion,dactyl
6013,more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents,dactyl
6014,faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold,dactyl
6015,hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow,dactyl
6016,silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,dactyl
6017,raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them,dactyl
6018,moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals,dactyl
6019,then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence,dactyl
6020,suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the blood red,dactyl
6021,moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and o'er the horizon,dactyl
6022,titan like stretches its hundred hands upon the mountain and meadow,dactyl
6023,seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together,dactyl
6024,broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,dactyl
6025,gleamed on the sky and sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead,dactyl
6026,columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were,dactyl
6027,thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr,dactyl
6028,then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting,dactyl
6029,whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house tops,dactyl
6030,started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled,dactyl
6031,these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard,dactyl
6032,speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish,dactyl
6033,we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grand pr',dactyl
6034,loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm yards,dactyl
6035,thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle,dactyl
6036,came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted,dactyl
6037,then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments,dactyl
6038,far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska,dactyl
6039,when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,dactyl
6040,or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river,dactyl
6041,such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses,dactyl
6042,broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed o'er the meadows,dactyl
6043,overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden,dactyl
6044,gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them,dactyl
6045,and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,dactyl
6046,lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the sea shore,dactyl
6047,motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed,dactyl
6048,slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden,dactyl
6049,knelt at her father's side and wailed aloud in her terror,dactyl
6050,then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom,dactyl
6051,through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber,dactyl
6052,and when she awoke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her,dactyl
6053,faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her,dactyl
6054,pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion,dactyl
6055,still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,dactyl
6056,reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her,dactyl
6057,and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses,dactyl
6058,then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people,dactyl
6059,let us bury him here by the sea when a happier season,dactyl
6060,brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,dactyl
6061,then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the church yard',dactyl
6062,such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the sea side,dactyl
6063,having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,dactyl
6064,but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grand pr,dactyl
6065,and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,dactyl
6066,lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation,dactyl
6067,solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges,dactyl
6068,twas the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean,dactyl
6069,with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward,dactyl
6070,then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking,dactyl
6071,and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,dactyl
6072,leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins,dactyl
6073,many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand pr,dactyl
6074,when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,dactyl
6075,bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile,dactyl
6076,exile without an end and without an example in story,dactyl
6077,far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed,dactyl
6078,scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast,dactyl
6079,strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland,dactyl
6080,friendless homeless hopeless they wandered from city to city,dactyl
6081,from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas,dactyl
6082,from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters,dactyl
6083,seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean,dactyl
6084,deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth,dactyl
6085,friends they sought and homes and many despairing heart broken,dactyl
6086,asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside,dactyl
6087,written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards,dactyl
6088,long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,dactyl
6089,lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things,dactyl
6090,fair was she and young but alas before her extended,dactyl
6091,dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway,dactyl
6092,marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,dactyl
6093,passions long extinguished and hopes long dead and abandoned,dactyl
6094,as the emigrant's way o'er the western desert is marked by,dactyl
6095,camp fires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine,dactyl
6096,something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished,dactyl
6097,as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine,dactyl
6098,suddenly paused in the sky and fading slowly descended,dactyl
6099,into the east again from whence it late had arisen,dactyl
6100,sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her,dactyl
6101,urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit,dactyl
6102,she would commence again her endless search and endeavor,dactyl
6103,sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,dactyl
6104,sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom,dactyl
6105,he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him,dactyl
6106,sometimes a rumor a hearsay an inarticulate whisper,dactyl
6107,came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward,dactyl
6108,sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,dactyl
6109,but it was long ago in some far off place or forgotten,dactyl
6110,gabriel lajeunesse' they said 'oh yes we have seen him,dactyl
6111,he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies,dactyl
6112,coureurs des bois are they and famous hunters and trappers',dactyl
6113,gabriel lajeunesse' said others 'oh yes we have seen him,dactyl
6114,he is a voyageur in the lowlands of louisiana',dactyl
6115,then would they say 'dear child why dream and wait for him longer,dactyl
6116,are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others,dactyl
6117,who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal,dactyl
6118,here is baptiste leblanc the notary's son who has loved thee,dactyl
6119,many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy,dactyl
6120,thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherine's tresses',dactyl
6121,then would evangeline answer serenely but sadly 'i cannot,dactyl
6122,whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere,dactyl
6123,for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway,dactyl
6124,many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness',dactyl
6125,thereupon the priest her friend and father confessor,dactyl
6126,said with a smile 'o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee,dactyl
6127,talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted,dactyl
6128,if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning,dactyl
6129,back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment,dactyl
6130,that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain,dactyl
6131,patience accomplish thy labor accomplish thy work of affection,dactyl
6132,sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike,dactyl
6133,therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike,dactyl
6134,purified strengthened perfected and rendered more worthy of heaven',dactyl
6135,cheered by the good man's words evangeline labored and waited,dactyl
6136,still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,dactyl
6137,but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered 'despair not',dactyl
6138,thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort,dactyl
6139,bleeding barefooted over the shards and thorns of existence,dactyl
6140,let me essay o muse to follow the wanderer's footsteps,dactyl
6141,not through each devious path each changeful year of existence,dactyl
6142,but as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley,dactyl
6143,far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water,dactyl
6144,here and there in some open space and at intervals only,dactyl
6145,then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it,dactyl
6146,though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur,dactyl
6147,happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet,dactyl
6148,it was the month of may far down the beautiful river,dactyl
6149,past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash,dactyl
6150,into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi,dactyl
6151,floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen,dactyl
6152,it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked,dactyl
6153,nation scattered along the coast now floating together,dactyl
6154,bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune,dactyl
6155,men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay,dactyl
6156,sought for their kith and their kin among the few acred farmers,dactyl
6157,on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas,dactyl
6158,with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician,dactyl
6159,onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests,dactyl
6160,day after day they glided adown the turbulent river,dactyl
6161,night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders,dactyl
6162,now through rushing chutes among green islands where plumelike,dactyl
6163,cotton trees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current,dactyl
6164,then emerged into broad lagoons where silvery sand bars,dactyl
6165,lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin,dactyl
6166,shining with snow white plumes large flocks of pelicans waded,dactyl
6167,level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river,dactyl
6168,shaded by china trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens,dactyl
6169,stood the houses of planters with negro cabins and dove cots,dactyl
6170,they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,dactyl
6171,where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron,dactyl
6172,sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward,dactyl
6173,they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine,dactyl
6174,soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,dactyl
6175,which like a network of steel extended in every direction,dactyl
6176,over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress,dactyl
6177,met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid air,dactyl
6178,waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals,dactyl
6179,deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons,dactyl
6180,home to their roosts in the cedar trees returning at sunset,dactyl
6181,or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter,dactyl
6182,lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,dactyl
6183,gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,dactyl
6184,down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin,dactyl
6185,dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them,dactyl
6186,and o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,dactyl
6187,strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed,dactyl
6188,as at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,dactyl
6189,far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,dactyl
6190,so at the hoof beats of fate with sad forebodings of evil,dactyl
6191,shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it,dactyl
6192,but evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision that faintly,dactyl
6193,floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight,dactyl
6194,it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom,dactyl
6195,through those shadowy aisles had gabriel wandered before her,dactyl
6196,and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer,dactyl
6197,then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen,dactyl
6198,and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure,dactyl
6199,sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle,dactyl
6200,wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,dactyl
6201,breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest,dactyl
6202,soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music,dactyl
6203,multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,dactyl
6204,over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches,dactyl
6205,but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness,dactyl
6206,and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence,dactyl
6207,then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,dactyl
6208,silent at times then singing familiar canadian boat songs,dactyl
6209,such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers,dactyl
6210,while through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,dactyl
6211,far offindistinctas of wave or wind in the forest,dactyl
6212,mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator,dactyl
6213,thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them,dactyl
6214,lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya,dactyl
6215,water lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations,dactyl
6216,made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus,dactyl
6217,lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen,dactyl
6218,faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,dactyl
6219,and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands,dactyl
6220,fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,dactyl
6221,near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber,dactyl
6222,soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended,dactyl
6223,under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin,dactyl
6224,safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward,dactyl
6225,tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered,dactyl
6226,over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar,dactyl
6227,swinging from its great arms the trumpet flower and the grapevine,dactyl
6228,hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob,dactyl
6229,on whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending descending,dactyl
6230,were the swift humming birds that flitted from blossom to blossom,dactyl
6231,such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it,dactyl
6232,filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven,dactyl
6233,lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial,dactyl
6234,nearer and ever nearer among the numberless islands,dactyl
6235,darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water,dactyl
6236,urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers,dactyl
6237,northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver,dactyl
6238,at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn,dactyl
6239,dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness,dactyl
6240,somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written,dactyl
6241,gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless,dactyl
6242,sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow,dactyl
6243,swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island,dactyl
6244,but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos,dactyl
6245,so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows,dactyl
6246,all undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers,dactyl
6247,angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden,dactyl
6248,swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie,dactyl
6249,after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,dactyl
6250,as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden,dactyl
6251,said with a sigh to the friendly priest 'o father felician,dactyl
6252,something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders,dactyl
6253,is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition,dactyl
6254,or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit',dactyl
6255,then with a blush she added 'alas for my credulous fancy,dactyl
6256,unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning',dactyl
6257,but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered,dactyl
6258,daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning,dactyl
6259,feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface,dactyl
6260,is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden,dactyl
6261,therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions,dactyl
6262,gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward,dactyl
6263,on the banks of the tche are the towns of st maur and st martin,dactyl
6264,there the long wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,dactyl
6265,there the long absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold,dactyl
6266,beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit trees,dactyl
6267,under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens,dactyl
6268,bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest,dactyl
6269,they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana',dactyl
6270,with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey,dactyl
6271,softly the evening came the sun from the western horizon,dactyl
6272,like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape,dactyl
6273,twinkling vapors arose and sky and water and forest,dactyl
6274,seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together,dactyl
6275,hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver,dactyl
6276,floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water,dactyl
6277,filled was evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness,dactyl
6278,touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling,dactyl
6279,glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her,dactyl
6280,then from a neighboring thicket the mocking bird wildest of singers,dactyl
6281,swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,dactyl
6282,shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,dactyl
6283,that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen,dactyl
6284,plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness,dactyl
6285,seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes,dactyl
6286,single notes were then heard in sorrowful low lamentation,dactyl
6287,till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision,dactyl
6288,as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops,dactyl
6289,shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches,dactyl
6290,with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion,dactyl
6291,slowly they entered the tche where it flows through the green opelousas,dactyl
6292,and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland,dactyl
6293,saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling,dactyl
6294,sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle,dactyl
6295,near to the bank of the river o'ershadowed by oaks from whose branches,dactyl
6296,garlands of spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,dactyl
6297,such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide,dactyl
6298,stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman a garden,dactyl
6299,girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,dactyl
6300,filling the air with fragrance the house itself was of timbers,dactyl
6301,hewn from the cypress tree and carefully fitted together,dactyl
6302,large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported,dactyl
6303,rose wreathed vine encircled a broad and spacious veranda,dactyl
6304,haunt of the humming bird and the bee extended around it,dactyl
6305,at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden,dactyl
6306,stationed the dove cots were as love's perpetual symbol,dactyl
6307,scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals,dactyl
6308,silence reigned o'er the place the line of shadow and sunshine,dactyl
6309,ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow,dactyl
6310,and from its chimney top ascending and slowly expanding,dactyl
6311,into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose,dactyl
6312,in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway,dactyl
6313,through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,dactyl
6314,into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending,dactyl
6315,full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas,dactyl
6316,hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,dactyl
6317,stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grape vines,dactyl
6318,just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,dactyl
6319,mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups,dactyl
6320,sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin,dactyl
6321,broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero,dactyl
6322,gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master,dactyl
6323,round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing,dactyl
6324,quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness,dactyl
6325,that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape,dactyl
6326,slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding,dactyl
6327,fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded,dactyl
6328,wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening,dactyl
6329,suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle,dactyl
6330,rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean,dactyl
6331,silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,dactyl
6332,and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance,dactyl
6333,then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden,dactyl
6334,saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him,dactyl
6335,suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward,dactyl
6336,rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder,dactyl
6337,when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith,dactyl
6338,hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden,dactyl
6339,there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer,dactyl
6340,gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces,dactyl
6341,laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful,dactyl
6342,thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings,dactyl
6343,stole o'er the maiden's heart and basil somewhat embarrassed,dactyl
6344,broke the silence and said 'if you came by the atchafalaya,dactyl
6345,how have you nowhere encountered my gabriel's boat on the bayous',dactyl
6346,over evangeline's face at the words of basil a shade passed,dactyl
6347,tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent,dactyl
6348,gone is gabriel gone' and concealing her face on his shoulder,dactyl
6349,all her o'erburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented,dactyl
6350,then the good basil saidand his voice grew blithe as he said it,dactyl
6351,be of good cheer my child it is only to day he departed,dactyl
6352,foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses,dactyl
6353,moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit,dactyl
6354,could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence,dactyl
6355,thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever,dactyl
6356,ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles,dactyl
6357,he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,dactyl
6358,tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him,dactyl
6359,unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards,dactyl
6360,thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains,dactyl
6361,hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver,dactyl
6362,therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover,dactyl
6363,he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him,dactyl
6364,up and away to morrow and through the red dew of the morning,dactyl
6365,we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison',dactyl
6366,then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river,dactyl
6367,borne aloft on his comrades' arms came michael the fiddler,dactyl
6368,long under basil's roof had he lived like a god on olympus,dactyl
6369,having no other care than dispensing music to mortals,dactyl
6370,far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle,dactyl
6371,long live michael' they cried 'our brave acadian minstrel',dactyl
6372,as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway,dactyl
6373,father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man,dactyl
6374,kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured,dactyl
6375,hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,dactyl
6376,laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters,dactyl
6377,much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci devant blacksmith,dactyl
6378,all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor,dactyl
6379,much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,dactyl
6380,and of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them,dactyl
6381,each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise,dactyl
6382,thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda,dactyl
6383,entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil,dactyl
6384,waited his late return and they rested and feasted together,dactyl
6385,over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended,dactyl
6386,all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver,dactyl
6387,fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors,dactyl
6388,brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight,dactyl
6389,then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman,dactyl
6390,poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion,dactyl
6391,lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco,dactyl
6392,thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened,dactyl
6393,welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless,dactyl
6394,welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one,dactyl
6395,here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers,dactyl
6396,here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer,dactyl
6397,smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water,dactyl
6398,all the year round the orange groves are in blossom and grass grows,dactyl
6399,more in a single night than a whole canadian summer,dactyl
6400,here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies,dactyl
6401,here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber,dactyl
6402,with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses,dactyl
6403,after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests,dactyl
6404,no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads,dactyl
6405,burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle',dactyl
6406,speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,dactyl
6407,while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table,dactyl
6408,so that the guests all started and father felician astounded,dactyl
6409,suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff half way to his nostrils,dactyl
6410,but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer,dactyl
6411,only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever,dactyl
6412,for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate,dactyl
6413,cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell',dactyl
6414,then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching,dactyl
6415,sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda,dactyl
6416,it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters,dactyl
6417,who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman,dactyl
6418,merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors,dactyl
6419,friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers,dactyl
6420,meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other,dactyl
6421,drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together,dactyl
6422,but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding,dactyl
6423,from the accordant strings of michael's melodious fiddle,dactyl
6424,broke up all further speech away like children delighted,dactyl
6425,all things forgotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening,dactyl
6426,whirl of the giddy dance as it swept and swayed to the music,dactyl
6427,dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments,dactyl
6428,meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman,dactyl
6429,sat conversing together of past and present and future,dactyl
6430,while evangeline stood like one entranced for within her,dactyl
6431,olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music,dactyl
6432,heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness,dactyl
6433,came o'er her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden,dactyl
6434,beautiful was the night behind the black wall of the forest,dactyl
6435,tipping its summit with silver arose the moon on the river,dactyl
6436,fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,dactyl
6437,like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit,dactyl
6438,nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden,dactyl
6439,poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions,dactyl
6440,unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian,dactyl
6441,fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews,dactyl
6442,hung the heart of the maiden the calm and the magical moonlight,dactyl
6443,seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings,dactyl
6444,as through the garden gate and beneath the shade of the oak trees,dactyl
6445,passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie,dactyl
6446,silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and fire flies,dactyl
6447,gleamed and floated away in mingled and infinite numbers,dactyl
6448,over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens,dactyl
6449,shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship,dactyl
6450,save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,dactyl
6451,as if a hand had appeared and written upon them 'upharsin',dactyl
6452,and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire flies,dactyl
6453,wandered alone and she cried 'o gabriel o my beloved,dactyl
6454,art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee,dactyl
6455,art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me,dactyl
6456,ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie,dactyl
6457,ah how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me,dactyl
6458,ah how often beneath this oak returning from labor,dactyl
6459,thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers,dactyl
6460,when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee',dactyl
6461,loud and sudden and near the notes of a whippoorwill sounded,dactyl
6462,like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets,dactyl
6463,farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence,dactyl
6464,patience' whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness,dactyl
6465,and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded 'to morrow',dactyl
6466,bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden,dactyl
6467,bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses,dactyl
6468,with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal,dactyl
6469,farewell' said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold,dactyl
6470,see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine,dactyl
6471,and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming',dactyl
6472,farewell' answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended,dactyl
6473,down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting,dactyl
6474,thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness,dactyl
6475,swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,dactyl
6476,blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert,dactyl
6477,not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded,dactyl
6478,found they the trace of his course in lake or forest or river,dactyl
6479,nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain,dactyl
6480,rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country,dactyl
6481,till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes,dactyl
6482,weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord,dactyl
6483,that on the day before with horses and guides and companions,dactyl
6484,gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies,dactyl
6485,far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains,dactyl
6486,lift through perpetual snows their lofty and luminous summits,dactyl
6487,down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway,dactyl
6488,opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,dactyl
6489,westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee,dactyl
6490,eastward with devious course among the wind river mountains,dactyl
6491,through the sweet water valley precipitate leaps the nebraska,dactyl
6492,and to the south from fontaine qui bout and the spanish sierras,dactyl
6493,fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert,dactyl
6494,numberless torrents with ceaseless sound descend to the ocean,dactyl
6495,like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations,dactyl
6496,spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies,dactyl
6497,billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,dactyl
6498,bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas,dactyl
6499,over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck,dactyl
6500,over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses,dactyl
6501,fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel,dactyl
6502,over them wander the scattered tribes of ishmael's children,dactyl
6503,staining the desert with blood and above their terrible war trails,dactyl
6504,circles and sails aloft on pinions majestic the vulture,dactyl
6505,like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,dactyl
6506,by invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens,dactyl
6507,here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders,dactyl
6508,here and there rise groves from the margins of swift running rivers,dactyl
6509,and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert,dactyl
6510,climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook side,dactyl
6511,and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven,dactyl
6512,like the protecting hand of god inverted above them,dactyl
6513,into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains,dactyl
6514,gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him,dactyl
6515,day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil,dactyl
6516,followed his flying steps and thought each day to o'ertake him,dactyl
6517,sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp fire,dactyl
6518,rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall,dactyl
6519,when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes,dactyl
6520,and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,dactyl
6521,hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana,dactyl
6522,showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them,dactyl
6523,once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered,dactyl
6524,into their little camp an indian woman whose features,dactyl
6525,wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow,dactyl
6526,she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people,dactyl
6527,from the far off hunting grounds of the cruel camanches,dactyl
6528,where her canadian husband a coureur des bois had been murdered,dactyl
6529,touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome,dactyl
6530,gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them,dactyl
6531,on the buffalo meat and the venison cooked on the embers,dactyl
6532,but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions,dactyl
6533,worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,dactyl
6534,stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering fire light,dactyl
6535,flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets,dactyl
6536,then at the door of evangeline's tent she sat and repeated,dactyl
6537,slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent,dactyl
6538,all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses,dactyl
6539,much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another,dactyl
6540,hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed,dactyl
6541,moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,dactyl
6542,yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,dactyl
6543,she in turn related her love and all its disasters,dactyl
6544,mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended,dactyl
6545,still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror,dactyl
6546,passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis,dactyl
6547,mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden,dactyl
6548,but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam,dactyl
6549,fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,dactyl
6550,till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest,dactyl
6551,then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation,dactyl
6552,told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom,dactyl
6553,that through the pines o'er her father's lodge in the hush of the twilight,dactyl
6554,breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden,dactyl
6555,till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,dactyl
6556,and nevermore returned nor was seen again by her people,dactyl
6557,silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened,dactyl
6558,to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her,dactyl
6559,seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress,dactyl
6560,slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose,dactyl
6561,lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor,dactyl
6562,touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland,dactyl
6563,with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches,dactyl
6564,swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers,dactyl
6565,filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret,dactyl
6566,subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,dactyl
6567,as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow,dactyl
6568,it was no earthly fear a breath from the region of spirits,dactyl
6569,seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment,dactyl
6570,that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom,dactyl
6571,with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished,dactyl
6572,early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee,dactyl
6573,said as they journeyed along 'on the western slope of these mountains,dactyl
6574,dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission,dactyl
6575,much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus,dactyl
6576,loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him',dactyl
6577,then with a sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered,dactyl
6578,let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us',dactyl
6579,thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains,dactyl
6580,just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices,dactyl
6581,and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river,dactyl
6582,saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission,dactyl
6583,under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village,dactyl
6584,knelt the black robe chief with his children a crucifix fastened,dactyl
6585,high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines,dactyl
6586,looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it,dactyl
6587,this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches,dactyl
6588,of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers,dactyl
6589,mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches,dactyl
6590,silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching,dactyl
6591,knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions,dactyl
6592,but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen,dactyl
6593,forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower,dactyl
6594,slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them,dactyl
6595,welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression,dactyl
6596,hearing the homelike sounds of his mother tongue in the forest,dactyl
6597,and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam,dactyl
6598,there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maize ear,dactyl
6599,feasted and slaked their thirst from the water gourd of the teacher,dactyl
6600,soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered,dactyl
6601,nor six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated,dactyl
6602,on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes,dactyl
6603,told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey',dactyl
6604,soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness,dactyl
6605,but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow flakes,dactyl
6606,fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed,dactyl
6607,far to the north he has gone' continued the priest 'but in autumn,dactyl
6608,when the chase is done will return again to the mission',dactyl
6609,then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive,dactyl
6610,let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted',dactyl
6611,so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow,dactyl
6612,mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions,dactyl
6613,homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission,dactyl
6614,slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other,dactyl
6615,days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing,dactyl
6616,green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her,dactyl
6617,lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming,dactyl
6618,cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels,dactyl
6619,then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens,dactyl
6620,blushed at each blood red ear for that betokened a lover,dactyl
6621,but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield,dactyl
6622,even the blood red ear to evangeline brought not her lover,dactyl
6623,patience' the priest would say 'have faith and thy prayer will be answered,dactyl
6624,look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,dactyl
6625,see how its leaves are turned to the north as true as the magnet,dactyl
6626,this is the compass flower that the finger of god has planted,dactyl
6627,here in the houseless wild to direct the traveller's journey,dactyl
6628,over the sea like pathless limitless waste of the desert,dactyl
6629,such in the soul of man is faith the blossoms of passion,dactyl
6630,gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance,dactyl
6631,but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly,dactyl
6632,only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter,dactyl
6633,crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe',dactyl
6634,so came the autumn and passed and the winteryet gabriel came not,dactyl
6635,blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird,dactyl
6636,sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not,dactyl
6637,but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted,dactyl
6638,sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom,dactyl
6639,far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests,dactyl
6640,gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river,dactyl
6641,and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence,dactyl
6642,saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission,dactyl
6643,when over weary ways by long and perilous marches,dactyl
6644,she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests,dactyl
6645,found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin,dactyl
6646,thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places,dactyl
6647,divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden,dactyl
6648,now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions,dactyl
6649,now in the noisy camps and the battle fields of the army,dactyl
6650,now in secluded hamlets in towns and populous cities,dactyl
6651,like a phantom she came and passed away unremembered,dactyl
6652,fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey,dactyl
6653,faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended,dactyl
6654,each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,dactyl
6655,leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow,dactyl
6656,then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,dactyl
6657,dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthly horizon,dactyl
6658,as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning,dactyl
6659,in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware waters,dactyl
6660,guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle,dactyl
6661,stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded,dactyl
6662,there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty,dactyl
6663,and the streets still re echo the names of the trees of the forest,dactyl
6664,as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested,dactyl
6665,there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile,dactyl
6666,finding among the children of penn a home and a country,dactyl
6667,there old ren leblanc had died and when he departed,dactyl
6668,saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants,dactyl
6669,something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,dactyl
6670,something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger,dactyl
6671,and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers,dactyl
6672,for it recalled the past the old acadian country,dactyl
6673,where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters,dactyl
6674,so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor,dactyl
6675,ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining,dactyl
6676,thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps,dactyl
6677,as from the mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning,dactyl
6678,roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us,dactyl
6679,sun illumined with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,dactyl
6680,so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her,dactyl
6681,dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway,dactyl
6682,which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance,dactyl
6683,gabriel was not forgotten within her heart was his image,dactyl
6684,clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him,dactyl
6685,only more beautiful made by his death like silence and absence,dactyl
6686,into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not,dactyl
6687,over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured,dactyl
6688,he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent,dactyl
6689,patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others,dactyl
6690,this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her,dactyl
6691,so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices,dactyl
6692,suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma,dactyl
6693,other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow,dactyl
6694,meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour,dactyl
6695,thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting,dactyl
6696,lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,dactyl
6697,where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,dactyl
6698,where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected,dactyl
6699,night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated,dactyl
6700,loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city,dactyl
6701,high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper,dactyl
6702,day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs,dactyl
6703,plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market,dactyl
6704,met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings,dactyl
6705,then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,dactyl
6706,presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,dactyl
6707,darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn,dactyl
6708,and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september,dactyl
6709,flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,dactyl
6710,so death flooded life and o'erflowing its natural margin,dactyl
6711,spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence,dactyl
6712,wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor,dactyl
6713,but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger,dactyl
6714,only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants,dactyl
6715,crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless,dactyl
6716,then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands,dactyl
6717,now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket,dactyl
6718,meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seemed to echo,dactyl
6719,softly the words of the lord 'the poor ye always have with you',dactyl
6720,thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying,dactyl
6721,looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there,dactyl
6722,gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,dactyl
6723,such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,dactyl
6724,or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance,dactyl
6725,unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,dactyl
6726,into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter,dactyl
6727,thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent,dactyl
6728,wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse,dactyl
6729,sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden,dactyl
6730,and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,dactyl
6731,that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty,dactyl
6732,then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind,dactyl
6733,distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church,dactyl
6734,while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted,dactyl
6735,sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco,dactyl
6736,soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit,dactyl
6737,something within her said 'at length thy trials are ended',dactyl
6738,and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness,dactyl
6739,noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants,dactyl
6740,moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence,dactyl
6741,closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces,dactyl
6742,where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside,dactyl
6743,many a languid head upraised as evangeline entered,dactyl
6744,turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence,dactyl
6745,fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison,dactyl
6746,and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler,dactyl
6747,laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever,dactyl
6748,many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time,dactyl
6749,vacant their places were or filled already by strangers,dactyl
6750,suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,dactyl
6751,still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder,dactyl
6752,ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers,dactyl
6753,and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning,dactyl
6754,then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,dactyl
6755,that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows,dactyl
6756,on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man,dactyl
6757,long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples,dactyl
6758,but as he lay in the morning light his face for a moment,dactyl
6759,seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood,dactyl
6760,so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying,dactyl
6761,hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,dactyl
6762,as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals,dactyl
6763,that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over,dactyl
6764,motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted,dactyl
6765,seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,dactyl
6766,darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking,dactyl
6767,then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations,dactyl
6768,heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded,dactyl
6769,whispered a gentle voice in accents tender and saint like,dactyl
6770,gabriel o my beloved' and died away into silence,dactyl
6771,then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood,dactyl
6772,green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them,dactyl
6773,village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow,dactyl
6774,as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision,dactyl
6775,tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,dactyl
6776,vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside,dactyl
6777,vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered,dactyl
6778,died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken,dactyl
6779,vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him,dactyl
6780,kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom,dactyl
6781,sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness,dactyl
6782,as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement,dactyl
6783,all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow,dactyl
6784,all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing,dactyl
6785,all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience,dactyl
6786,and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,dactyl
6787,meekly she bowed her own and murmured 'father i thank thee',dactyl
6788,still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow,dactyl
6789,side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping,dactyl
6790,under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard,dactyl
6791,in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed,dactyl
6792,daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,dactyl
6793,thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever,dactyl
6794,thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy,dactyl
6795,thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors,dactyl
6796,thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey,dactyl
6797,still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches,dactyl
6798,dwells another race with other customs and language,dactyl
6799,only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic,dactyl
6800,linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile,dactyl
6801,wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom,dactyl
6802,in the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy,dactyl
6803,maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,dactyl
6804,and by the evening fire repeat evangeline's story,dactyl
6805,while from its rocky caverns the deep voiced neighboring ocean,dactyl
6806,speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest,dactyl
