Eating bits of his extremities that lay in the path they crept, pyrrhic
No outofbounds for every nook they could roam, pyrrhic
In his one room shack  the pigsty he called home, pyrrhic
Pooing on his bed and table sometimes  boldly in his stare, pyrrhic
And not inside his drawers pots and pockets did they spare, pyrrhic
By heavens for such a man in his youthful prime, pyrrhic
There was none dirtier whose home had more grime, pyrrhic
The constant reek of gunge  what better invitation, pyrrhic
To every pest flying or crawling for cohabitation, pyrrhic
Hed hoped to kill the poverty that to him had seemed to glue, pyrrhic
With the job for which hed been invited for an interview, pyrrhic
Alas His file jacket was barely held by its leather threads, pyrrhic
And his results and certificates partly eaten were in shreds, pyrrhic
Enough hed thought and bought a mousetrap, pyrrhic
With smoked fish bait hed soon heard the traps first clap, pyrrhic
Of the fathers mothers and offsprings hed caught one, pyrrhic
With this and others after hed planned his vengeful fun, pyrrhic
With glee to the street hed stepped with the vermin, pyrrhic
The fate of which only he could now determine, pyrrhic
Hed doused it with petrol amidst street kids  cheers, pyrrhic
But oblivious of his folly and fates inaudible jeers, pyrrhic
With a single match strike it was engulfed in flames, pyrrhic
And what happened next he had none to apportion blames, pyrrhic
For in blind anguish the rat had dashed back into his room, pyrrhic
The house had charred smoking with a mile high plume, pyrrhic
You were an Afghan Farid Khan by name, pyrrhic
A name less known to the world today, pyrrhic
You ran away from home, pyrrhic
Because your own stepmother plotted against you, pyrrhic
Now you were runawayKhan, pyrrhic
You chose to be a knighterrant, pyrrhic
Soon became a military commander in Bihar, pyrrhic
Was renamed Sher Khan a title awarded , pyrrhic
By the Governor of Bihar, pyrrhic
Whom you saved from the jaws of a tiger, pyrrhic
So you became the Deputy Governor, pyrrhic
But wherever you went, pyrrhic
Your ruler feared your strength and potential, pyrrhic
And of course you were in trouble, pyrrhic
For instance during your stint, pyrrhic
In Baburs army you easily caught , pyrrhic
The Moghul Ruler attention  , pyrrhic
Who promptly exhorted one of his ministers , pyrrhic
Keep an eye on this young man, pyrrhic
He is clever, pyrrhic
And I see royal marks on his forehead, pyrrhic
You were shrewd enough , pyrrhic
To sense the great kings fear and suspicion, pyrrhic
You quit his army soon, pyrrhic
During your stint however , pyrrhic
You were sharp enough to notice, pyrrhic
The weakness in the Moghul system, pyrrhic
The  Rulers overdependence on his ministers, pyrrhic
I will not you told yourself, pyrrhic
Make the mistake when I become a ruler , pyrrhic
When Humayun Baburs son ascended the throne , pyrrhic
After his fathers death you saw, pyrrhic
The chance of a lifetime, pyrrhic
You inflicted a crushing defeat , pyrrhic
On him in the battle of Chausa in 1539 , pyrrhic
Became Sher Shah the Emperor, pyrrhic
From Farid Khan to Sher Shah, pyrrhic
An amazing trajectory, pyrrhic
Comparable to Napoleons, pyrrhic
You are acknowledged even today as a brilliant strategist , pyrrhic
A gifted administrator and a capable General, pyrrhic
Your whole life is indeed an object lesson , pyrrhic
In strategy diplomacy and administration, pyrrhic
India Post in the 1970s honoured you  , pyrrhic
By issuing a postal stamp, pyrrhic
You were by and large a role model for the later Moghul, pyrrhic
King Akbar the Great, pyrrhic
And at the same time a standing warning to him, pyrrhic
Dont collide headon with the Rajputs , pyrrhic
The fine warrior race of Rajasthan, pyrrhic
Akbar befriended them, pyrrhic
And had the best of both worlds, pyrrhic
But Emperor Aurangazeb, pyrrhic
Though he came much later , pyrrhic
Was too obtuse to follow this lesson , pyrrhic
Well you chose to take on the Rajputs, pyrrhic
And not surprisingly got into trouble, pyrrhic
Your earlier victory , pyrrhic
Over the Rajput King Maldeo of Marwar , pyrrhic
You achieved by causing dissension between the King , pyrrhic
And his able Generals by forging letters , pyrrhic
Which were as you rightly expected intercepted , pyrrhic
Maldeo left the battle field disgusted , pyrrhic
You won, pyrrhic
This strategy is known as Mitrabheda, pyrrhic
as spelt out in Panchatantra, pyrrhic
And you knew it by instinct, pyrrhic
All is fair in love and war, pyrrhic
Anyway yours was after all a pyrrhic victory, pyrrhic
Considering your losses, pyrrhic
Which you yourself highly regretted, pyrrhic
Much earlier in your career however, pyrrhic
You practised a different strategy known as Mitralabha , pyrrhic
Securing that is friends and allies , pyrrhic
You formed an alliance with Ujjaini Rajputs in Bihar , pyrrhic
And so were able to defeat the mighty Sultan of Bengal, pyrrhic
But later in your life you ignored , pyrrhic
This strategyat your peril , pyrrhic
The crows in Panchatantra were able , pyrrhic
To defeat the clever owls, pyrrhic
Because of the sane counsel, pyrrhic
they had from Chiranjeevin the wise crow, pyrrhic
Thats what the whole book , pyrrhic
Of Kakolukiyam of Panchtantra is about, pyrrhic
But you shunned counsellors , pyrrhic
Presumably because of the lesson , pyrrhic
That you had learnt earlier from the Moghuls, pyrrhic
So you lost your own life Labdhapranasam, pyrrhic
You resorted to Aparikhitakaraka illconsidered action, pyrrhic
Which Panchantra urges us to avoid , pyrrhic
In the year 1545 in the battle of Kalinjar, pyrrhic
For a small cause , pyrrhic
You besieged the historic Rajput Fort, pyrrhic
All your tactics failed, pyrrhic
Then you took a drastic step, pyrrhic
You decided to blow up , pyrrhic
The strong Fort with gunpowder, pyrrhic
You yourself were blown up, pyrrhic
Oh such a spring in sixtythree, pyrrhic
the orchard there for miles theyd see, pyrrhic
light shades of pink that tinged the clouds, pyrrhic
on blossoms where the bees would crowd, pyrrhic
and dance from tree to tree, pyrrhic
The sun splashed yellow all around, pyrrhic
young lovers kissed outside the town, pyrrhic
beneath the copse of trees, pyrrhic
The rumble of a summer storm, pyrrhic
disguised the din of truth forlorn, pyrrhic
as thousands marched this summer day, pyrrhic
our nations sons in blue and gray, pyrrhic
like bees of spring they swarmed, pyrrhic
But not for life and not for play, pyrrhic
instead a pyrrhic death ballet , pyrrhic
the worst that man performs, pyrrhic
The orchard where they struck was shattered, pyrrhic
both limb of man and tree were scattered, pyrrhic
the rubble of their hate was strewn, pyrrhic
where once a fruit of peace was grown , pyrrhic
blood and life was splattered, pyrrhic
But in these fields a seed was sewn, pyrrhic
and grows to bear a truth thats known, pyrrhic
nourishing what matters, pyrrhic
The tears that drip like autumn leaves, pyrrhic
shed for the dead and those they freed, pyrrhic
are buried by first winters fall, pyrrhic
and mourned by coyotes lonely call, pyrrhic
now joined by mothers pleas, pyrrhic
While there a girl with tattered shawl, pyrrhic
sobs for her love lost in the brawl, pyrrhic
beneath the copse of trees , pyrrhic
On a dark and stormy, pyrrhic
night in Salem , pyrrhic
into the Beanery , pyrrhic
they stalk , pyrrhic
like heroes of , pyrrhic
the Trojan war , pyrrhic
in gravid stillness, pyrrhic
they sit, pyrrhic
calm polite , pyrrhic
proper distant , pyrrhic
Who is dreaming , pyrrhic
whom today I wonder , pyrrhic
They read aloud about the theater , pyrrhic
a ritual only death can halt, pyrrhic
if death has the temerity to try , pyrrhic
Arrows of contention are caught , pyrrhic
deftly on thick shields , pyrrhic
The thrust and parry , pyrrhic
of old soldiers , pyrrhic
is a joy to see , pyrrhic
Then out of nowhere he says , pyrrhic
Mitera Ive had enough , pyrrhic
of this You win , pyrrhic
Tears channel her arctic cheeks , pyrrhic
She says How dare you catapult , pyrrhic
a burning cow onto my , pyrrhic
one straw roof youyou tartuffel , pyrrhic
At the strike of uffel , pyrrhic
upon his shield heads turn , pyrrhic
As she lies helpless as , pyrrhic
a fig in hummus he says , pyrrhic
My wooden horse has burned , pyrrhic
My crews sailed away , pyrrhic
to join old wives , pyrrhic
This wars gone on , pyrrhic
for too long Mitera , pyrrhic
She interrupts, pyrrhic
This isnt war Uhl , pyrrhic
its love , pyrrhic
The devil take love then , pyrrhic
he says I want to be like , pyrrhic
Schliemann and bring light , pyrrhic
to my buried Troy , pyrrhic
That violates the , pyrrhic
agreement we signed, pyrrhic
in blood Uhl she cries, pyrrhic
Will my peerless person , pyrrhic
perish without your proper , pyrrhic
Pyrrhic persiflage , pyrrhic
Oh all the vats of pitch Ive , pyrrhic
stored to heat and heave , pyrrhic
at your bald battered bean, pyrrhic
Ill never have a chance to use , pyrrhic
Bald and batter me no beans , pyrrhic
he roars Back to the kitchen , pyrrhic
woman Ill never , pyrrhic
forgive you for this , pyrrhic
The rooms agog , pyrrhic
Live drama so enriches , pyrrhic
our uneventful lives , pyrrhic
We wait for his reply , pyrrhic
With helmet dented by , pyrrhic
recriminations , pyrrhic
he hobbles to the door , pyrrhic
Pausing to breathe in , pyrrhic
the night refulgent , pyrrhic
with the reek of romance , pyrrhic
His liquid voice finds , pyrrhic
her burning ears , pyrrhic
for the last time , pyrrhic
He borrows from the great , pyrrhic
turnip nose himself , pyrrhic
Farewell my little chickadee , pyrrhic
you cant cheat an honest man , pyrrhic
forever She laughs and says , pyrrhic
Ill see you later at , pyrrhic
Bentleys you old has been , pyrrhic
I thought youd find , pyrrhic
a better exit , pyrrhic
line than that , pyrrhic
A fart in the face isnt , pyrrhic
quite what I expected , pyrrhic
from the great Ulysses , pyrrhic
The room exhales, pyrrhic
Have we been conned we wonder , pyrrhic
I groan So thats what a , pyrrhic
marriage of old thespians is like , pyrrhic
Perpetual improvisation, pyrrhic
Yoicks, pyrrhic
When you get to the kings palace, pyrrhic
My brother, pyrrhic
Whenever you get the chance to sit and dine with the king, pyrrhic
Do not raise your shoulders so high, pyrrhic
So high above the level of your head, pyrrhic
Do not ask him for too many favors, pyrrhic
Do not stir up old quarrels, pyrrhic
Never should you reflect upon the past bone of contention, pyrrhic
Remember all those who helped you, pyrrhic
Those who introduced you to the king, pyrrhic
And his cohorts, pyrrhic
Do not eat hastily, pyrrhic
Nor drink noisily, pyrrhic
In the presence of the princes, pyrrhic
Uphold your beautiful courageous character, pyrrhic
Do not deflower the young princess there, pyrrhic
Do not stand or leave the presence of the king, pyrrhic
With crumpled shirts or an unkempt bowtie, pyrrhic
Many lives have been lost before you gained acceptance, pyrrhic
And recognition to stay in that glamorous palace, pyrrhic
It sounds though like Pyrrhic victory in my ears, pyrrhic
Our gains do not outweigh our losses, pyrrhic
May we sing the glad song of Moses, pyrrhic
I shall be consoled by the long stretch, pyrrhic
Of the dotted semibreve, pyrrhic
Twas a dark knight , pyrrhic
whence there came a pawn the hushed crowded movie house, pyrrhic
A phantom of horror sprung out of the rookery that wrought deadly havoc, pyrrhic
Renting asunder innocent audience members, pyrrhic
Anticipating Batman annihilate evil within Manichean eternal duel, pyrrhic
Extant within imaginary world of Gotham portrayed on the silver screen, pyrrhic
When out of the black curtained theater tear gas canisters got hurled pell mell, pyrrhic
Accompanied by a fusillade of heavy machine gun fire, pyrrhic
Sheering many lives , pyrrhic
Many in the prime ascent sans parabola of adulthood, pyrrhic
The youngest a sixyearold girl transformed into an ashen colored corpse, pyrrhic
Which death yet revealed to her young mother, pyrrhic
Critically wounded and clamoring for said daughter, pyrrhic
While teetering on the brink of mortality, pyrrhic
Oblivious to stricken offspring, pyrrhic
While family friends relatives and anonymous prayers , pyrrhic
And this heartfelt genuine communiqu, pyrrhic
From me  a self styled nonestablishmentarian , pyrrhic
Gungho to invoke a mandate that high powered firearms, pyrrhic
Must be much less accessible , pyrrhic
Ie bulletproof laws need implementation pronto, pyrrhic
So inhabitants of these United States do not fear for their lives, pyrrhic
Nor feel akin to a potential prey sighted in the crosshairs , pyrrhic
Wantonly gunned down from some grinning joker, pyrrhic
Slaking glee from mass killing as to appease unquenchable thirst, pyrrhic
To avenge some psychotic nemesis gloating to slay, pyrrhic
With a vengeance and contrived vendetta, pyrrhic
Promulgating pandemonium and grisly bloody aftermath, pyrrhic
Yet despite such horrific heinous atrocity, pyrrhic
Bravery and sacrifice witnessed and extolled , pyrrhic
From heroic instinctual motive to offer themselves as human shield, pyrrhic
So that carnage less devastating than toll on madmans hit list, pyrrhic
Now in solitary confinement and even if executed , pyrrhic
Would be a Pyrrhic salve to those forever deprived of loved ones, pyrrhic
Burning with an eternal sorrow no matter , pyrrhic
Generosity of cyber sympathizers across World Wide Web , pyrrhic
Plus the president of these United States, pyrrhic
Reach out showering kindness analogous to Borealis raiment , pyrrhic
As you flee behind you hear, pyrrhic
Your hate filled screaming foes, pyrrhic
Pillaging and burning, pyrrhic
Their tutored hatred beyond reason, pyrrhic
For no reason, pyrrhic
Loudspeakers hastily erected amongst the rubble, pyrrhic
Play a dirge of victory, pyrrhic
As they hold a pyrrhic parade, pyrrhic
As you flee to who knows where, pyrrhic
North south east or west , pyrrhic
Dont know Dont care, pyrrhic
Just away, pyrrhic
Unknown lands ahead, pyrrhic
There be monsters, pyrrhic
You only hope youve left them behind, pyrrhic
As you flee you see the broken crowds, pyrrhic
A caravan of the barely living, pyrrhic
Some men and children in uniforms, pyrrhic
Now just costumes, pyrrhic
Clutch their weapons that failed them, pyrrhic
The debris of war litter the poisoned earth, pyrrhic
Twisted metal entomb twisted flesh, pyrrhic
Broken souls pass by, pyrrhic
Your town is gone, pyrrhic
Your home is gone, pyrrhic
Your family  alive or dead  gone, pyrrhic
Your life  your past  gone, pyrrhic
Your food  the last scrap  gone, pyrrhic
Your water  the last drop  gone, pyrrhic
Your hope  gone, pyrrhic
You have nothing, pyrrhic
But you are not nothing, pyrrhic
As you flee become the seed, pyrrhic
That penetrates a fertile land, pyrrhic
And makes it grow afresh, pyrrhic
You may fall on stony ground, pyrrhic
As many will, pyrrhic
As you flee you reach the well meaning camps, pyrrhic
A pale shade of existence, pyrrhic
Living in forgotten limbo, pyrrhic
As you flee strike out to promised lands, pyrrhic
Schizophrenic peoples that both welcome and revile, pyrrhic
As you join their underclass, pyrrhic
A scapegoat for all their ills, pyrrhic
Cast aside your skills your art your education, pyrrhic
And toil and sweat on the work that noone wants, pyrrhic
And when you finally accept this is your lot, pyrrhic
Toil and sweat for your children, pyrrhic
Who can never understand your struggle your journey, pyrrhic
But carry the seed of your people, pyrrhic
Maybe one day they will return home, pyrrhic
And rebuild, pyrrhic

The thorns so thick so spiny so brutal, pyrrhic
Their thicket so dark impenetrable, pyrrhic
Then two years were spent were lost were gone, pyrrhic
And they then stood gasping fought out forlorn, pyrrhic
For a moment a second a damned micron, pyrrhic
They thought it was pointless a habit to be torn, pyrrhic
In their eyes the glow faded and dimmed, pyrrhic
Their embrace unclenched they stept out for a swim, pyrrhic
They said for a moment that moment thus spent, pyrrhic
Is it not to be my love princess , pyrrhic
No my heart my life it isnt, pyrrhic
Thunder failed fires paled and banked, pyrrhic
Storms rolled back to join their ranks, pyrrhic
The sun shone watery clear pale, pyrrhic
We all rejoiced to see it fail, pyrrhic
Yet when came night the dark the cold, pyrrhic
He stepped to their kingdom arms out to hold, pyrrhic
His eyes glowed again eager for dark eyrie, pyrrhic
His blood tingled for her sweet evil sincerty, pyrrhic
He waited but briefly even brief too much, pyrrhic
Two days too long even without her touch, pyrrhic
He crashed out to find her his life dark love, pyrrhic
He swept about caught in morass in mud, pyrrhic
Where did she go she left departed, pyrrhic
She said they were safer alone thus parted, pyrrhic
The waves crashed down destroyed the kingdom, pyrrhic
Time smoothed the sand waited for the new one, pyrrhic
A drum of rain on window pane, pyrrhic
A streak of tears of dripping rain, pyrrhic
A power melted now cool urbane, pyrrhic
A life now gone now leeched now strained, pyrrhic
A slipping sliding treachrous lane, pyrrhic
A fading ripping tearing pain, pyrrhic
A spectatr watches smiles blames, pyrrhic
A future deprived no glory , pyrrhic
Dress up ghouls, pyrrhic
Deaths Masquerade Ball, pyrrhic
Each ghastly dance, pyrrhic
Creates the queue, pyrrhic
A death head prize, pyrrhic
For willing waltz, pyrrhic
A looming grave, pyrrhic
The victory taunts, pyrrhic
A dying knave, pyrrhic
A pyrrhic flaunt, pyrrhic
I believe that writing is like spilling blood out of the carotid, pyrrhic
Onto a canvas of sponge, pyrrhic
This sponge can never be satiated, pyrrhic
It takes generations and trillions of miles of neurons, pyrrhic
Just to make a stain, pyrrhic
My marrow is strained in such a glorious fashion, pyrrhic
In attempt to produce even more lovely RBCs, pyrrhic
So that I may contribute but just a mere speck, pyrrhic
On this ethereal construct, pyrrhic
Today I saw a man with hollow eyes buying homes with the skulls of rats, pyrrhic
These homes onced belonged to living souls, pyrrhic
The money machine came rolling in with the disinterest of  a cow chewing cud, pyrrhic
Masticating the precious juice from the canvas that once served, pyrrhic
As a font of energy an expulsion of electrons something sacrosanct, pyrrhic
To those who felt alive in a world consumed by dead ridiculous intentions, pyrrhic
Now All of the canvasbloodsponges have dried out in these places and, pyrrhic
As a result , pyrrhic
The universe seems to recoil back in on itself as if in fear of , pyrrhic
The disasterous implications, pyrrhic
The dust seems to layer the meninges ever so slightly, pyrrhic
Until I realize the fact that by doing so I allow the miscreants running, pyrrhic
This synthetic freak show of media pogrom and unheralded greed, pyrrhic
To stand in Pyrrhic victory, pyrrhic
Somehow this is all, pyrrhic
Compounded with an unaccountable need to accumulate as much , pyrrhic
Material nonsense as possible because it helps fill, pyrrhic
The inexplicable void , pyrrhic
I just want to keep pumping blood out onto this convoluted stage and, pyrrhic
Scream in the ignorant face of the man arrogantly cutting others off, pyrrhic
During rush hour as though where he needed to get to was so much more , pyrrhic
Important than everyone elses destination, pyrrhic
The disconnect is here, pyrrhic
Look into the countenances of those around you, pyrrhic
Thankfully there are those rare souls you see periodically, pyrrhic
With some light left behind those orbs, pyrrhic
They havent been made grotesque by the modern world, pyrrhic
They have been spending time with their canvas, pyrrhic
Come to me and put thine sweet eyes, spondee

When I was young the broom sage grew so tall, spondee
It towered over me fuzzy tickling, spondee
Right there in front of momma harvesting, spondee
Harvesting just enough sage for a broom, spondee
Broom sage to sweep the hearth clean of debris, spondee
A hearth white washed with Georgia kaolin , spondee
Nothing to cover the dirty black sooted bricks, spondee
In summer even the inside was white washed, spondee
Taller now towering over the sage, spondee
Whose sick sparse shoots reach up to claim sunlight, spondee
Purple hues shimmer in breeze wait for spring , spondee
Renewed to live again again again, spondee
Like sage cut fashioned into a hearth broom, spondee
Life is short wears away the youthful joy, spondee
Soon the end in sight retired to kindling, spondee
Laid down upon the white washed inside brick, spondee
Awaiting morn when a spark will ignite, spondee
A roaring fire will spring forth ablaze, spondee
While all the family gathers around, spondee
Warmed by the hearth of a happy snug home, spondee
Walkin on the highways searchin down the byways, spondee
Tromps a lonely figure on the Highland roads, spondee
Peerin from the Highdown breezin through the lake town, spondee
Askin of a question erry where he goes, spondee
And its Marry gather round for she hasna yet been found, spondee

To the fairest Highland lassie from Loch Leven to the sea, spondee
Heres a lass they proudly say fair as June and sweet as May, spondee
And its sure that shes the fairest in the Highland mountains steep, spondee
Through the heather you may go climb the mountains capped with snow, spondee
But youll never find a better lass on which your eyes to peep, spondee
Some of them were pouty others even dowdy, spondee
These he thought would never do in fifteen years, spondee
Beauty on the outside nothin on the inside, spondee
Leaves a girl with nothin when it fades to tears, spondee
Travlin all around for she hasna yet been found, spondee
Hes come lookin for the truest lass as only one can be, spondee
With a letter do deliver as you see it says to give er, spondee
To the fairest Highland lassie from Loch Leven to the sea , spondee
Heres a lass they proudly say fair as June and sweet as May, spondee
But you canna tell the fairest one except you see them all, spondee
And the lassies sweetly smile for this stranger to beguile, spondee
As e treads throughout the Highlands from the winter to the fall, spondee
From the banks of Lomon up to Durness roamin, spondee
Hows a wight to judge betwixt a thousand score, spondee
Steps were waxing weary days were growing dreary, spondee
Till e saw a lass e hadna met before, spondee

And the truest lass is fair for the true shall never wear, spondee
So I say that heres the truest fairest lass Ive chanced to meet, spondee
Then she opened up the scroll and she read it to the full, spondee
And for those who chance to wonder I shall quote you what she read, spondee
When the fairest lass I find if our wishes are aligned, spondee
I should wish to know thee better lass and then perhaps to wed, spondee

Theres a fairy ring ancient and old, spondee
And at times you can hear, spondee
Perfect echoes of sound , spondee
Tis the music of ages untold, spondee
For the crickets keep time, spondee
To a waltz or a reel, spondee
And the birds fill that lovely expanse, spondee
With the notes to a tune, spondee
With a light airy feel , spondee
In the field where the butterflies dance, spondee
Where the wildflowers bloom, spondee
With a sweet perfume, spondee
In a rainbow of colours and shades, spondee
Where the maids hurry down, spondee
From the hilltop town, spondee
And the butterflies dance with the maids, spondee
Where they splash in the stream, spondee
Or they lie and dream, spondee
Where the bullfrogs thrum, spondee
While the butterflies wing, spondee
And the hummingbirds hum, spondee
While the merry maids sing, spondee
In the field where the butterflies dance, spondee
On a winged pirouette, spondee
Or a six legged slip, spondee
How they dance and they wheel and they turn, spondee
And their wings flash in time, spondee
To a bright Scottish trip, spondee
While the lassies turn round by the burn, spondee
For the crickets keep time, spondee
To a waltz or a reel, spondee
And the birds fill that lovely expanse, spondee
With the notes to a tune, spondee
With a light airy feel , spondee
In the field where the butterflies dance, spondee

Simon is full of glissandi and spondee today, spondee
and writes poetry for the literati that is ok , spondee
it is good to know wonderful words , spondee
I sit on the terrace facing east a sparrow, spondee
has a nest nearby it sits on the phone line , spondee
shrieks without the slightest hint of glissandi, spondee
 want me to go away sees me a threat to its eggs , spondee

protesting my presence But in the end it realized , spondee
I was not a risk and took to sing with much , spondee
spondees impressing it mate, spondee
But Simon is right if we go on ending the habitat  , spondee
for song birds we leave crickets to annoy musical , spondee
ears when heralding spring  , spondee
Its feet are tiny dimeter, spondee
Body spirit soul trimeter, spondee
Would you look at those ears and eyes, spondee
Whose tetrameter rhyme defies, spondee
Its foot with pentameter toes, spondee
Smelled by monometer nose, spondee
Dont fret when its iamb voice speaks , spondee
Cheerful quatrains for days and weeks, spondee
Stand still while it jabbers spondee, spondee
In stanzas of metered trochee, spondee
Well my friend please do not pretend, spondee
Or youll cause more stress at the end, spondee
Each verse it speaks is oh so sweet, spondee
For its growing Longfellow feet, spondee
Sit back relax put on a smile, spondee
Youve been zapped by a poets grandchild, spondee
Cuddled dreams in the cradle repressed, trochee
And reality is now a past regressed, trochee
From romance all poetic feelings neglected, trochee
And nature is a wrinkled face rejected, trochee
Fantasy written from smoggy streets of dirt, trochee
Bars and night clubs and passing flirts, trochee
A story where a prince and a princeess, trochee
Lives only in dusty books left on the shelves, trochee
They seek a whim like a game of leisure, trochee
Once the flower taken then a loathed pleasure, trochee
Meek like sheep or lamb the flower bends, trochee
To have her throat cut see her blood sheds, trochee
Cruel reality woman is feeble and disarmed, trochee
Wily man a wolf in sheeps cloak disguised, trochee
When romance is still a book just written, trochee
Human hearts with plague shall be bitten, trochee
Romance and honesty in natures nest born, trochee
Nostalgic memories nowadays outworn, trochee
In den at desk a poetry being composed, trochee
Feelings dearth a dead body being rhymed, trochee
True poetry never be baked inside a stove, trochee
Nature is the open book for bards to rove, trochee
Browse the pastures mountains and lands, trochee
Listen to winds anthem to critters heavenly bands, trochee
Iambic pentameter is the poetic sheep that skips, trochee
And butteflies give the nimble trochee that leaps, trochee
No form of poetry needs a rhyming echo, trochee
Save in nature where harmony can flow, trochee
No feeling is true but only when gained, trochee
Where nature is her virginity unstained, trochee
When a man and a woman sharing romance, trochee
Like the rock and the flower in warm embrace, trochee
Harsh as it could no harm might be inflicted, trochee
The flower safe with mountains trust injected, trochee

a pure Cherokee, trochee
I felt so proud that I had, trochee
in my ancestry, trochee
blood of those who roamed this land, trochee
throughout history, trochee

and my nose grew long, trochee
I supposed the Cherokee, trochee

Mom is Welsh and proud of it, trochee
saying I am full, trochee
of her Welsh vim and vigor, trochee
plus a poets soul, trochee
Of my sisters theres just one, trochee

One day looking at the sky, trochee
though I dont know why, trochee
standing in my underwear, trochee
what did I descry, trochee
There were piglets in my yard, trochee
Do you think I lie, trochee
Pink with wings They took off, trochee
up into the sky, trochee
All the times I heard it said, trochee
Yeah when pigs can fly, trochee
How I wished for a witness, trochee
that could testify, trochee
But nobody was around , trochee
not that I could spy, trochee
I grew tired and then lay down, trochee
with a weary sigh, trochee
That strange sight which I had seen, trochee
I could not deny, trochee
till I woke my head pounding, trochee
so bad I could cry, trochee
With my senses coming back, trochee
I guessed by and by, trochee
It was me and not pink pigs, trochee
that was flying high, trochee
Showers April brought to us , trochee
showers more than sun, trochee
and I just kept wondering, trochee
when they would be done, trochee
May arrived and in the sky, trochee
clouds were dark with rain, trochee
Then it even snowed a bit, trochee
Nature seemed insane, trochee
My poor roses on the bush, trochee
still they havent bloomed, trochee
Yet today the sun came out, trochee
so they are not doomed, trochee
Just a few more sunny days , trochee
I might see flowers, trochee
Mother Nature please for now, trochee
delay May showers, trochee
Showers fall and robins call, trochee
Buds grow on the trees, trochee
Meadows green long grasses lean, trochee
warmed by Aprils breeze, trochee
Flowers beam and streamlets gleam, trochee
on each mountain slope, trochee
Colors sing and everything, trochee
blossoms love and hope, trochee
Sentinel oh sentinel, trochee
lofty by the sea, trochee
lonely on a craggy coast, trochee
standing tirelessly, trochee
Watching over ships that sail, trochee
in the dark of night, trochee
guiding them ashore with its, trochee
welcome blinking light, trochee
Storms rise up assailing it , trochee
fierce and turbulent , trochee
causing waves to pound it with, trochee
mighty discontent, trochee
Let the tempests clamor and, trochee
crash They cannot fell, trochee
our towering resilient, trochee
stalwart sentinel, trochee
Well toss me off with a trochee, trochee
And tickle me spondees as well, trochee
If it isnt The Issues Poetry Slam, trochee
And it seems that the bggers can spell, trochee
I spy some spectacular dactyls, trochee

And some sht kickin humorous nerve, trochee

While all the family gathers around, trochee
Warmed by the hearth of a happy snug home, trochee
It would be a wondrous thing, trochee
If I chanced to see, trochee
Unicorns of ocean deep, trochee
Swimming nearby me, trochee
Each one with a  spiraled tusk, trochee
Jutting from its jaw, trochee
Swimming round about me oh, trochee
I would be in awe, trochee
Clicking squealing whistling, trochee
Swimming in their pod, trochee
If I tried to join their group, trochee
Would that seem too odd, trochee
I could try to click at them, trochee
With my little tongue, trochee
If I whistled would they think, trochee
Songs were being sung, trochee
Swimming with some narwhals though , trochee
It will never be, trochee
For Id freeze so deep beneath, trochee
That cold Arctic Sea, trochee
There across the movie screen, trochee
treats were dancing and, trochee
telling us to find them at, trochee
the concession stand, trochee
Yes I knew I should not go, trochee
Id just eaten lunch, trochee
At the snack bar they beguiled, trochee
Have a little munch, trochee
M  Ms and Hershey bars , trochee
chocolaty delight , trochee
with such smooth deep voices asked, trochee
me to take a bite, trochee
Hot dogs nearly barked out Dont, trochee
let us go to waste, trochee
Meanwhile candies sweetly sang, trochee
Have a little taste, trochee
Then an Ice cream bar chimed in, trochee
Take a bite of me, trochee
I can take a licking too, trochee
and most happily, trochee
Pepperoni pizza was, trochee
sure a little tease, trochee
calling out with Nachos Hey, trochee
Weve got lots of cheese, trochee
At that dinein theater, trochee
clamored other food, trochee
Subway Arbys many more, trochee
sounding rather rude, trochee
They were all competing  but, trochee
Popcorn filled the air, trochee
with its heady butter scent, trochee
What a circus there, trochee
All were screaming out to me, trochee
though I dont know why, trochee
Bite me Bite me Dont foods know, trochee
bitten they will die, trochee
Well I bought the popcorn as, trochee

We already had our lunch, trochee

Perched on Piscess cusp forsaking Platos cave, trochee
Puppets casting shadows chancing me a slave, trochee
They hang from dreams of higher forms allures, trochee
Contempt in self when loving carnal cores, trochee
Haunted by womens passions kept in Spirits, trochee
Dawns my sleeping stages now inherits, trochee
Marionettes aloft eternal twists, trochee
of spinning truths with lies recalling trysts, trochee
Killing prone volitions changing essence, trochee
Chosen starlights beings guiding presence, trochee
Upon a love in purest form demands, trochee
Forgotten suicides of ego strands, trochee
Risking Pirsigs fate in Zen and journey, trochee
Waging sanity a bounty worthy, trochee
The stringing of my soul and bracing seeks, trochee
A pulling truth beyond this death it speaks, trochee
With the end of days upon them, trochee
Nears the time of final battle, trochee
In the halls of high Valhalla, trochee
Asgard senses its death rattle, trochee
In the forest crows the rooster , trochee
In the sky the sun does darken, trochee
In the cave the hound is howling, trochee
To these signs the Aesir harken, trochee
Heimdall blows the Gjallarhorn, trochee
Dark the rainbow bridge is turning, trochee
Vivid lightning cleaves Yggdrasil, trochee
Then the central tree is burning, trochee
Aesir watch in fascination, trochee
See volcanoes spew like fountains, trochee
See the heavens splitting open, trochee
See the oceans climb the mountains, trochee
See the continents convulsing, trochee
See the forests burn to ashes, trochee
See the sons of Mim awaken, trochee
In the fatal lightning flashes, trochee
As the winds consume the wasteland, trochee
From the south Surtr advances, trochee
With his minions tearing corpses, trochee
Bright his sword and sharp his lances, trochee
Aesir then prepare their weapons, trochee
Eyes are clear and arms are steady, trochee
The Midgard serpent Jrmungandr, trochee
Upon the battle plain is ready, trochee
With his heavy hammer Mjolnir, trochee
Strides the mighty god of thunder, trochee
To do battle with the serpent, trochee
And to rend the world asunder, trochee
Fall descends as Summer leaves , trochee
Autumn cools a skewed romance , trochee
Here we find a heart that grieves , trochee
While the other lives to dance , trochee
Short the span of peak allure , trochee
Egos start to hum the blues , trochee
Mirrors follow and procure , trochee
Any truth you wish to view , trochee
If the other shoe be age, trochee
Let it drop accept the dread, trochee
Earplugs mute his musics rage, trochee
Yours in stacks beneath the bed , trochee
Flattery can quickly blind , trochee
When its served in large amounts , trochee
Dont leave common sense behind, trochee
With a dwindling bank account, trochee
Cunning were her noxious machinations, trochee
Choosing those who never stood a chance, trochee
Masterful projecting of temptations, trochee
Brilliant timing her alluring glance, trochee
Naive innocence alerted weakness, trochee
Perfect prey a rug beneath her feet, trochee
Wary of her charm he played to meekness, trochee
Vamps are blinded by their own conceit, trochee
Love projecting trust her highest rated, trochee
Self assured to win this rueful game, trochee
But his insight unappreciated, trochee
Destined to dethrone this queen of shame, trochee
Midnight luggage packed as she lay sleeping, trochee
Daybreak finding him no longer there, trochee
Not his absence roused her ardent weeping , trochee
Rather roles reversed and woe to bear, trochee
All her hidden plans new beau new city, trochee
Lost its joie de vivre without a chump, trochee
Debit card replaced by selfish pity, trochee
Catatonic stupor being dumped , trochee
She was fooled assured the man had fallen, trochee
Not a clue his quietly keeping score, trochee
Retribution silently came calling, trochee
As a sliding key beneath her door, trochee
Who is that big fat Santa man, trochee
Im not quite sure if Im a fan, trochee
He steals the cookies I leave out, trochee
He judges me to cry and pout, trochee
He watches me both night and day, trochee
Just like that mean old NSA, trochee
And does he even pay those elves, trochee
Who make the toys and sit on shelves, trochee
Hes not as jolly as he seems, trochee
The mall is filled with childrens screams, trochee
He pulls them up upon his lap, trochee
But they dont buy that Ho Ho crap, trochee
Why does he hide in the North Pole, trochee
Why does he give the naughty coal, trochee
 And does he give the poor kids toys, trochee
They need them most those girls and boys, trochee
Could he not give them food and bread, trochee
Cause he can give them mine instead, trochee
I fear for some he never came, trochee
Some kids have never heard his name, trochee
Why punish them for not believing, trochee
I simply cant find this relieving, trochee
If hes amazing like they say, trochee
Why doesnt he just make their day, trochee
Why does he not show bad kids love, trochee
Why not feed poor kids he hears of, trochee
Why not show them that he exists, trochee
Why not put them on his nice list, trochee
FROM fairest creatures we desire increase, iambic
That thereby beautys rose might never die, iambic
But as the riper should by time decease, iambic
His tender heir might bear his memory, iambic
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, iambic
Feedst thy lightst flame with selfsubstantial fuel, iambic
Making a famine where abundance lies, iambic
Thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel, iambic
Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament, iambic
And only herald to the gaudy spring, iambic
Within thine own bud buriest thy content, iambic
And tender churl makest waste in niggarding, iambic
Pity the world or else this glutton be, iambic
To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee, iambic
When forty winters shall beseige thy brow, iambic
And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field, iambic
Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now, iambic
Will be a tatterd weed of small worth held, iambic
Then being askd where all thy beauty lies, iambic
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days, iambic
To say within thine own deepsunken eyes, iambic
Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise, iambic
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use, iambic
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine, iambic
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse, iambic
Proving his beauty by succession thine, iambic
This were to be new made when thou art old, iambic
And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold, iambic
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, iambic
Now is the time that face should form another, iambic
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, iambic
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother, iambic
For where is she so fair whose uneard womb, iambic
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry, iambic
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb, iambic
Of his selflove to stop posterity, iambic
Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee, iambic
Calls back the lovely April of her prime, iambic
So thou through windows of thine age shall see, iambic
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time, iambic
But if thou live rememberd not to be, iambic
Die single and thine image dies with thee, iambic
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend, iambic
Upon thyself thy beautys legacy, iambic
Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend, iambic
And being frank she lends to those are free, iambic
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse, iambic
The bounteous largess given thee to give, iambic
Profitless usurer why dost thou use, iambic
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live, iambic
For having traffic with thyself alone, iambic
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive, iambic
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone, iambic
What acceptable audit canst thou leave, iambic
Thy unused beauty must be tombd with thee, iambic
Which used lives th executor to be, iambic
Those hours that with gentle work did frame, iambic
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, iambic
Will play the tyrants to the very same, iambic
And that unfair which fairly doth excel, iambic
For neverresting time leads summer on, iambic
To hideous winter and confounds him there, iambic
Sap chequed with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, iambic
Beauty oersnowd and bareness every where, iambic
Then were not summers distillation left, iambic
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, iambic
Beautys effect with beauty were bereft, iambic
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was, iambic
But flowers distilld though they with winter meet, iambic
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet, iambic
Then let not winters ragged hand deface, iambic
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilld, iambic
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place, iambic
With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilld, iambic
That use is not forbidden usury, iambic
Which happies those that pay the willing loan, iambic
Thats for thyself to breed another thee, iambic
Or ten times happier be it ten for one, iambic
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art, iambic
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee, iambic
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart, iambic
Leaving thee living in posterity, iambic
Be not selfwilld for thou art much too fair, iambic
To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir, iambic
Lo in the orient when the gracious light, iambic
Lifts up his burning head each under eye, iambic
Doth homage to his newappearing sight, iambic
Serving with looks his sacred majesty, iambic
And having climbd the steepup heavenly hill, iambic
Resembling strong youth in his middle age, iambic
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, iambic
Attending on his golden pilgrimage, iambic
But when from highmost pitch with weary car, iambic
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day, iambic
The eyes fore duteous now converted are, iambic
From his low tract and look another way, iambic
So thou thyself outgoing in thy noon, iambic
Unlookd on diest unless thou get a son, iambic
Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly, iambic
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy, iambic
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly, iambic
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy, iambic
If the true concord of welltuned sounds, iambic
By unions married do offend thine ear, iambic
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds, iambic
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear, iambic
Mark how one string sweet husband to another, iambic
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering, iambic
Resembling sire and child and happy mother, iambic
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing, iambic
Whose speechless song being many seeming one, iambic
Sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none, iambic
Is it for fear to wet a widows eye, iambic
That thou consumest thyself in single life, iambic
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die, iambic
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife, iambic
The world will be thy widow and still weep, iambic
That thou no form of thee hast left behind, iambic
When every private widow well may keep, iambic
By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind, iambic
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend, iambic
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it, iambic
But beautys waste hath in the world an end, iambic
And kept unused the user so destroys it, iambic
No love toward others in that bosom sits, iambic
That on himself such murderous shame commits, iambic
For shame deny that thou bearst love to any, iambic
Who for thyself art so unprovident, iambic
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many, iambic
But that thou none lovest is most evident, iambic
For thou art so possessd with murderous hate, iambic
That gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire, iambic
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate, iambic
Which to repair should be thy chief desire, iambic
O change thy thought that I may change my mind, iambic
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love, iambic
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind, iambic
Or to thyself at least kindhearted prove, iambic
Make thee another self for love of me, iambic
That beauty still may live in thine or thee, iambic
As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest, iambic
In one of thine from that which thou departest, iambic
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest, iambic
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest, iambic
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase, iambic
Without this folly age and cold decay, iambic
If all were minded so the times should cease, iambic
And threescore year would make the world away, iambic
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store, iambic
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish, iambic
Look whom she best endowd she gave the more, iambic
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish, iambic
She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby, iambic
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die, iambic
When I do count the clock that tells the time, iambic
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night, iambic
When I behold the violet past prime, iambic
And sable curls all silverd oer with white, iambic
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves, iambic
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, iambic
And summers green all girded up in sheaves, iambic
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard, iambic
Then of thy beauty do I question make, iambic
That thou among the wastes of time must go, iambic
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, iambic
And die as fast as they see others grow, iambic
And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence, iambic
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence, iambic
O that you were yourself but love you are, iambic
No longer yours than you yourself here live, iambic
Against this coming end you should prepare, iambic
And your sweet semblance to some other give, iambic
So should that beauty which you hold in lease, iambic
Find no determination then you were, iambic
Yourself again after yourselfs decease, iambic
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear, iambic
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay, iambic
Which husbandry in honour might uphold, iambic
Against the stormy gusts of winters day, iambic
And barren rage of deaths eternal cold, iambic
O none but unthrifts Dear my love you know, iambic
You had a father let your son say so, iambic
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck, iambic
And yet methinks I have astronomy, iambic
But not to tell of good or evil luck, iambic
Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality, iambic
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell, iambic
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind, iambic
Or say with princes if it shall go well, iambic
By oft predict that I in heaven find, iambic
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive, iambic
And constant stars in them I read such art, iambic
As truth and beauty shall together thrive, iambic
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert, iambic
Or else of thee this I prognosticate, iambic
Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date, iambic
When I consider every thing that grows, iambic
Holds in perfection but a little moment, iambic
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows, iambic
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment, iambic
When I perceive that men as plants increase, iambic
Cheered and chequed even by the selfsame sky, iambic
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease, iambic
And wear their brave state out of memory, iambic
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay, iambic
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight, iambic
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay, iambic
To change your day of youth to sullied night, iambic
And all in war with Time for love of you, iambic
As he takes from you I engraft you new, iambic
But wherefore do not you a mightier way, iambic
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time, iambic
And fortify yourself in your decay, iambic
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme, iambic
Now stand you on the top of happy hours, iambic
And many maiden gardens yet unset, iambic
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers, iambic
Much liker than your painted counterfeit, iambic
So should the lines of life that life repair, iambic
Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen, iambic
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair, iambic
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men, iambic
To give away yourself keeps yourself still, iambic
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill, iambic
Who will believe my verse in time to come, iambic
If it were filld with your most high deserts, iambic
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb, iambic
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts, iambic
If I could write the beauty of your eyes, iambic
And in fresh numbers number all your graces, iambic
The age to come would say This poet lies, iambic
Such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces, iambic
So should my papers yellowd with their age, iambic
Be scornd like old men of less truth than tongue, iambic
And your true rights be termd a poets rage, iambic
And stretched metre of an antique song, iambic
But were some child of yours alive that time, iambic
You should live twice in it and in my rhyme, iambic
Shall I compare thee to a summers day, iambic
Thou art more lovely and more temperate, iambic
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, iambic
And summers lease hath all too short a date, iambic
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, iambic
And often is his gold complexion dimmd, iambic
And every fair from fair sometime declines, iambic
By chance or natures changing course untrimmd, iambic
But thy eternal summer shall not fade, iambic
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest, iambic
Nor shall Death brag thou wanderst in his shade, iambic
When in eternal lines to time thou growest, iambic
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, iambic
So long lives this and this gives life to thee, iambic
Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws, iambic
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood, iambic
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws, iambic
And burn the longlived phoenix in her blood, iambic
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets, iambic
And do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted Time, iambic
To the wide world and all her fading sweets, iambic
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime, iambic
O carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow, iambic
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen, iambic
Him in thy course untainted do allow, iambic
For beautys pattern to succeeding men, iambic
Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong, iambic
My love shall in my verse ever live young, iambic
A womans face with Natures own hand painted, iambic
Hast thou the mastermistress of my passion, iambic
A womans gentle heart but not acquainted, iambic
With shifting change as is false womens fashion, iambic
An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling, iambic
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, iambic
A man in hue all hues in his controlling, iambic
Much steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth, iambic
And for a woman wert thou first created, iambic
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell adoting, iambic
And by addition me of thee defeated, iambic
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing, iambic
But since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure, iambic
Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure, iambic
So is it not with me as with that Muse, iambic
Stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse, iambic
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use, iambic
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse, iambic
Making a couplement of proud compare, iambic
With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems, iambic
With Aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare, iambic
That heavens air in this huge rondure hems, iambic
O let me true in love but truly write, iambic
And then believe me my love is as fair, iambic
As any mothers child though not so bright, iambic
As those gold candles fixd in heavens air, iambic
Let them say more than like of hearsay well, iambic
I will not praise that purpose not to sell, iambic
My glass shall not persuade me I am old, iambic
So long as youth and thou are of one date, iambic
But when in thee times furrows I behold, iambic
Then look I death my days should expiate, iambic
For all that beauty that doth cover thee, iambic
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart, iambic
Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me, iambic
How can I then be elder than thou art, iambic
O therefore love be of thyself so wary, iambic
As I not for myself but for thee will, iambic
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary, iambic
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill, iambic
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain, iambic
Thou gavest me thine not to give back again, iambic
As an unperfect actor on the stage, iambic
Who with his fear is put besides his part, iambic
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage, iambic
Whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart, iambic
So I for fear of trust forget to say, iambic
The perfect ceremony of loves rite, iambic
And in mine own loves strength seem to decay, iambic
Oercharged with burden of mine own loves might, iambic
O let my books be then the eloquence, iambic
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast, iambic
Who plead for love and look for recompense, iambic
More than that tongue that more hath more expressd, iambic
O learn to read what silent love hath writ, iambic
To hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit, iambic
Mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld, iambic
Thy beautys form in table of my heart, iambic
My body is the frame wherein tis held, iambic
And perspective it is the painters art, iambic
For through the painter must you see his skill, iambic
To find where your true image pictured lies, iambic
Which in my bosoms shop is hanging still, iambic
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes, iambic
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done, iambic
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me, iambic
Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun, iambic
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee, iambic
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art, iambic
They draw but what they see know not the heart, iambic
Let those who are in favour with their stars, iambic
Of public honour and proud titles boast, iambic
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars, iambic
Unlookd for joy in that I honour most, iambic
Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread, iambic
But as the marigold at the suns eye, iambic
And in themselves their pride lies buried, iambic
For at a frown they in their glory die, iambic
The painful warrior famoused for fight, iambic
After a thousand victories once foild, iambic
Is from the book of honour razed quite, iambic
And all the rest forgot for which he toild, iambic
Then happy I that love and am beloved, iambic
Where I may not remove nor be removed, iambic
Lord of my love to whom in vassalage, iambic
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit, iambic
To thee I send this written embassage, iambic
To witness duty not to show my wit, iambic
Duty so great which wit so poor as mine, iambic
May make seem bare in wanting words to show it, iambic
But that I hope some good conceit of thine, iambic
In thy souls thought all naked will bestow it, iambic
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving, iambic
Points on me graciously with fair aspect, iambic
And puts apparel on my tatterd loving, iambic
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect, iambic
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee, iambic
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me, iambic
Weary with toil I haste me to my bed, iambic
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired, iambic
But then begins a journey in my head, iambic
To work my mind when bodys works expired, iambic
For then my thoughts from far where I abide, iambic
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee, iambic
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide, iambic
Looking on darkness which the blind do see, iambic
Save that my souls imaginary sight, iambic
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view, iambic
Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night, iambic
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new, iambic
Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind, iambic
For thee and for myself no quiet find, iambic
How can I then return in happy plight, iambic
That am debarrd the benefit of rest, iambic
When days oppression is not eased by night, iambic
But day by night and night by day oppressd, iambic
And each though enemies to eithers reign, iambic
Do in consent shake hands to torture me, iambic
The one by toil the other to complain, iambic
How far I toil still farther off from thee, iambic
I tell the day to please them thou art bright, iambic
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven, iambic
So flatter I the swartcomplexiond night, iambic
When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even, iambic
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer, iambic
And night doth nightly make griefs strength, iambic
When in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes, iambic
I all alone beweep my outcast state, iambic
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, iambic
And look upon myself and curse my fate, iambic
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, iambic
Featured like him like him with friends possessd, iambic
Desiring this mans art and that mans scope, iambic
With what I most enjoy contented least, iambic
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, iambic
Haply I think on thee and then my state, iambic
Like to the lark at break of day arising, iambic
From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate, iambic
For thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings, iambic
That then I scorn to change my state with kings, iambic
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought, iambic
I summon up remembrance of things past, iambic
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, iambic
And with old woes new wail my dear times waste, iambic
Then can I drown an eye unused to flow, iambic
For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night, iambic
And weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe, iambic
And moan the expense of many a vanishd sight, iambic
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone, iambic
And heavily from woe to woe tell oer, iambic
The sad account of forebemoaned moan, iambic
Which I new pay as if not paid before, iambic
But if the while I think on thee dear friend, iambic
All losses are restored and sorrows end, iambic
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts, iambic
Which I by lacking have supposed dead, iambic
And there reigns love and all loves loving parts, iambic
And all those friends which I thought buried, iambic
How many a holy and obsequious tear, iambic
Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye, iambic
As interest of the dead which now appear, iambic
But things removed that hidden in thee lie, iambic
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live, iambic
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, iambic
Who all their parts of me to thee did give, iambic
That due of many now is thine alone, iambic
Their images I loved I view in thee, iambic
And thou all they hast all the all of me, iambic
If thou survive my wellcontented day, iambic
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover, iambic
And shalt by fortune once more resurvey, iambic
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover, iambic
Compare them with the bettering of the time, iambic
And though they be outstrippd by every pen, iambic
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme, iambic
Exceeded by the height of happier men, iambic
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought, iambic
Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age, iambic
A dearer birth than this his love had brought, iambic
To march in ranks of better equipage, iambic
But since he died and poets better prove, iambic
Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love, iambic
Full many a glorious morning have I seen, iambic
Flatter the mountaintops with sovereign eye, iambic
Kissing with golden face the meadows green, iambic
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy, iambic
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride, iambic
With ugly rack on his celestial face, iambic
And from the forlorn world his visage hide, iambic
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace, iambic
Even so my sun one early morn did shine, iambic
With all triumphant splendor on my brow, iambic
But out alack he was but one hour mine, iambic
The region cloud hath maskd him from me now, iambic
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth, iambic
Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth, iambic
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day, iambic
And make me travel forth without my cloak, iambic
To let base clouds oertake me in my way, iambic
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke, iambic
Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, iambic
To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face, iambic
For no man well of such a salve can speak, iambic
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace, iambic
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief, iambic
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss, iambic
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief, iambic
To him that bears the strong offences cross, iambic
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds, iambic
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds, iambic
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done, iambic
Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud, iambic
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun, iambic
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud, iambic
All men make faults and even I in this, iambic
Authorizing thy trespass with compare, iambic
Myself corrupting salving thy amiss, iambic
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are, iambic
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense, iambic
Thy adverse party is thy advocate, iambic
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence, iambic
Such civil war is in my love and hate, iambic
That I an accessary needs must be, iambic
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me, iambic
Let me confess that we two must be twain, iambic
Although our undivided loves are one, iambic
So shall those blots that do with me remain, iambic
Without thy help by me be borne alone, iambic
In our two loves there is but one respect, iambic
Though in our lives a separable spite, iambic
Which though it alter not loves sole effect, iambic
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight, iambic
I may not evermore acknowledge thee, iambic
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame, iambic
Nor thou with public kindness honour me, iambic
Unless thou take that honour from thy name, iambic
But do not so I love thee in such sort, iambic
As thou being mine mine is thy good report, iambic
As a decrepit father takes delight, iambic
To see his active child do deeds of youth, iambic
So I made lame by fortunes dearest spite, iambic
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth, iambic
For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit, iambic
Or any of these all or all or more, iambic
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit, iambic
I make my love engrafted to this store, iambic
So then I am not lame poor nor despised, iambic
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give, iambic
That I in thy abundance am sufficed, iambic
And by a part of all thy glory live, iambic
Look what is best that best I wish in thee, iambic
This wish I have then ten times happy me, iambic
How can my Muse want subject to invent, iambic
While thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse, iambic
Thine own sweet argument too excellent, iambic
For every vulgar paper to rehearse, iambic
O give thyself the thanks if aught in me, iambic
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight, iambic
For whos so dumb that cannot write to thee, iambic
When thou thyself dost give invention light, iambic
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth, iambic
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate, iambic
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth, iambic
Eternal numbers to outlive long date, iambic
If my slight Muse do please these curious days, iambic
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise, iambic
O how thy worth with manners may I sing, iambic
When thou art all the better part of me, iambic
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring, iambic
And what is t but mine own when I praise thee, iambic
Even for this let us divided live, iambic
And our dear love lose name of single one, iambic
That by this separation I may give, iambic
That due to thee which thou deservest alone, iambic
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove, iambic
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, iambic
To entertain the time with thoughts of love, iambic
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive, iambic
And that thou teachest how to make one twain, iambic
By praising him here who doth hence remain, iambic
Take all my loves my love yea take them all, iambic
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before, iambic
No love my love that thou mayst true love call, iambic
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more, iambic
Then if for my love thou my love receivest, iambic
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest, iambic
But yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest, iambic
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest, iambic
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief, iambic
Although thou steal thee all my poverty, iambic
And yet love knows it is a greater grief, iambic
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury, iambic
Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows, iambic
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes, iambic
Those petty wrongs that liberty commits, iambic
When I am sometime absent from thy heart, iambic
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits, iambic
For still temptation follows where thou art, iambic
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won, iambic
Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed, iambic
And when a woman woos what womans son, iambic
Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed, iambic
Ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear, iambic
And chide try beauty and thy straying youth, iambic
Who lead thee in their riot even there, iambic
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth, iambic
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee, iambic
Thine by thy beauty being false to me, iambic
That thou hast her it is not all my grief, iambic
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly, iambic
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief, iambic
A loss in love that touches me more nearly, iambic
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye, iambic
Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her, iambic
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me, iambic
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her, iambic
If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain, iambic
And losing her my friend hath found that loss, iambic
Both find each other and I lose both twain, iambic
And both for my sake lay on me this cross, iambic
But heres the joy my friend and I are one, iambic
Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone, iambic
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see, iambic
For all the day they view things unrespected, iambic
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee, iambic
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed, iambic
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright, iambic
How would thy shadows form form happy show, iambic
To the clear day with thy much clearer light, iambic
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so, iambic
How would I say mine eyes be blessed made, iambic
By looking on thee in the living day, iambic
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade, iambic
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay, iambic
All days are nights to see till I see thee, iambic
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me, iambic
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, iambic
Injurious distance should not stop my way, iambic
For then despite of space I would be brought, iambic
From limits far remote where thou dost stay, iambic
No matter then although my foot did stand, iambic
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee, iambic
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land, iambic
As soon as think the place where he would be, iambic
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought, iambic
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, iambic
But that so much of earth and water wrought, iambic
I must attend times leisure with my moan, iambic
Receiving nought by elements so slow, iambic
But heavy tears badges of eithers woe, iambic
The other two slight air and purging fire, iambic
Are both with thee wherever I abide, iambic
The first my thought the other my desire, iambic
These presentabsent with swift motion slide, iambic
For when these quicker elements are gone, iambic
In tender embassy of love to thee, iambic
My life being made of four with two alone, iambic
Sinks down to death oppressd with melancholy, iambic
Until lifes composition be recured, iambic
By those swift messengers returnd from thee, iambic
Who even but now come back again assured, iambic
Of thy fair health recounting it to me, iambic
This told I joy but then no longer glad, iambic
I send them back again and straight grow sad, iambic
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war, iambic
How to divide the conquest of thy sight, iambic
Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar, iambic
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right, iambic
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie, iambic
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes, iambic
But the defendant doth that plea deny, iambic
And says in him thy fair appearance lies, iambic
To cide this title is impanneled, iambic
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart, iambic
And by their verdict is determined, iambic
The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part, iambic
As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part, iambic
And my hearts right thy inward love of heart, iambic
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took, iambic
And each doth good turns now unto the other, iambic
When that mine eye is famishd for a look, iambic
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother, iambic
With my loves picture then my eye doth feast, iambic
And to the painted banquet bids my heart, iambic
Another time mine eye is my hearts guest, iambic
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part, iambic
So either by thy picture or my love, iambic
Thyself away art resent still with me, iambic
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, iambic
And I am still with them and they with thee, iambic
Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight, iambic
Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight, iambic
How careful was I when I took my way, iambic
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust, iambic
That to my use it might unused stay, iambic
From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust, iambic
But thou to whom my jewels trifles are, iambic
Most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief, iambic
Thou best of dearest and mine only care, iambic
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief, iambic
Thee have I not lockd up in any chest, iambic
Save where thou art not though I feel thou art, iambic
Within the gentle closure of my breast, iambic
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part, iambic
And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear, iambic
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear, iambic
Against that time if ever that time come, iambic
When I shall see thee frown on my defects, iambic
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, iambic
Calld to that audit by advised respects, iambic
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass, iambic
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye, iambic
When love converted from the thing it was, iambic
Shall reasons find of settled gravity, iambic
Against that time do I ensconce me here, iambic
Within the knowledge of mine own desert, iambic
And this my hand against myself uprear, iambic
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part, iambic
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws, iambic
Since why to love I can allege no cause, iambic
How heavy do I journey on the way, iambic
When what I seek my weary travels end, iambic
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say, iambic
Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend, iambic
The beast that bears me tired with my woe, iambic
Plods dully on to bear that weight in me, iambic
As if by some instinct the wretch did know, iambic
His rider loved not speed being made from thee, iambic
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on, iambic
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide, iambic
Which heavily he answers with a groan, iambic
More sharp to me than spurring to his side, iambic
For that same groan doth put this in my mind, iambic
My grief lies onward and my joy behind, iambic
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence, iambic
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed, iambic
From where thou art why should I haste me thence, iambic
Till I return of posting is no need, iambic
O what excuse will my poor beast then find, iambic
When swift extremity can seem but slow, iambic
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind, iambic
In winged speed no motion shall I know, iambic
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace, iambic
Therefore desire of perfectst love being made, iambic
Shall neighno dull fleshin his fiery race, iambic
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade, iambic
Since from thee going he went wilfulslow, iambic
Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go, iambic
So am I as the rich whose blessed key, iambic
Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure, iambic
The which he will not every hour survey, iambic
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure, iambic
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare, iambic
Since seldom coming in the long year set, iambic
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are, iambic
Or captain jewels in the carcanet, iambic
So is the time that keeps you as my chest, iambic
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, iambic
To make some special instant special blest, iambic
By new unfolding his imprisond pride, iambic
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope, iambic
Being had to triumph being lackd to hope, iambic
What is your substance whereof are you made, iambic
That millions of strange shadows on you tend, iambic
Since every one hath every one one shade, iambic
And you but one can every shadow lend, iambic
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit, iambic
Is poorly imitated after you, iambic
On Helens cheek all art of beauty set, iambic
And you in Grecian tires are painted new, iambic
Speak of the spring and foison of the year, iambic
The one doth shadow of your beauty show, iambic
The other as your bounty doth appear, iambic
And you in every blessed shape we know, iambic
In all external grace you have some part, iambic
But you like none none you for constant heart, iambic
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem, iambic
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give, iambic
The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem, iambic
For that sweet odour which doth in it live, iambic
The cankerblooms have full as deep a dye, iambic
As the perfumed tincture of the roses, iambic
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly, iambic
When summers breath their masked buds discloses, iambic
But for their virtue only is their show, iambic
They live unwood and unrespected fade, iambic
Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so, iambic
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made, iambic
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth, iambic
When that shall fade my verse distills your truth, iambic
Not marble nor the gilded monuments, iambic
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme, iambic
But you shall shine more bright in these contents, iambic
Than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time, iambic
When wasteful war shall statues overturn, iambic
And broils root out the work of masonry, iambic
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn, iambic
The living record of your memory, iambic
Gainst death and alloblivious enmity, iambic
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room, iambic
Even in the eyes of all posterity, iambic
That wear this world out to the ending doom, iambic
So till the judgment that yourself arise, iambic
You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes, iambic
Sweet love renew thy force be it not said, iambic
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite, iambic
Which but today by feeding is allayd, iambic
Tomorrow sharpend in his former might, iambic
So love be thou although today thou fill, iambic
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness, iambic
Tomorrow see again and do not kill, iambic
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness, iambic
Let this sad interim like the ocean be, iambic
Which parts the shore where two contracted new, iambic
Come daily to the banks that when they see, iambic
Return of love more blest may be the view, iambic
Else call it winter which being full of care, iambic
Makes summers welcome thrice more wishd more rare, iambic
Being your slave what should I do but tend, iambic
Upon the hours and times of your desire, iambic
I have no precious time at all to spend, iambic
Nor services to do till you require, iambic
Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour, iambic
Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you, iambic
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour, iambic
When you have bid your servant once adieu, iambic
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought, iambic
Where you may be or your affairs suppose, iambic
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought, iambic
Save where you are how happy you make those, iambic
So true a fool is love that in your will, iambic
Though you do any thing he thinks no ill, iambic
That god forbid that made me first your slave, iambic
I should in thought control your times of pleasure, iambic
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave, iambic
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure, iambic
O let me suffer being at your beck, iambic
The imprisond absence of your liberty, iambic
And patience tame to sufferance bide each cheque, iambic
Without accusing you of injury, iambic
Be where you list your charter is so strong, iambic
That you yourself may privilege your time, iambic
To what you will to you it doth belong, iambic
Yourself to pardon of selfdoing crime, iambic
I am to wait though waiting so be hell, iambic
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well, iambic
If there be nothing new but that which is, iambic
Hath been before how are our brains beguiled, iambic
Which labouring for invention bear amiss, iambic
The second burden of a former child, iambic
O that record could with a backward look, iambic
Even of five hundred courses of the sun, iambic
Show me your image in some antique book, iambic
Since mind at first in character was done, iambic
That I might see what the old world could say, iambic
To this composed wonder of your frame, iambic
Whether we are mended or whether better they, iambic
Or whether revolution be the same, iambic
O sure I am the wits of former days, iambic
To subjects worse have given admiring praise, iambic
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, iambic
So do our minutes hasten to their end, iambic
Each changing place with that which goes before, iambic
In sequent toil all forwards do contend, iambic
Nativity once in the main of light, iambic
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd, iambic
Crooked elipses gainst his glory fight, iambic
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound, iambic
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, iambic
And delves the parallels in beautys brow, iambic
Feeds on the rarities of natures truth, iambic
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow, iambic
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand, iambic
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand, iambic
Is it thy will thy image should keep open, iambic
My heavy eyelids to the weary night, iambic
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken, iambic
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight, iambic
Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee, iambic
So far from home into my deeds to pry, iambic
To find out shames and idle hours in me, iambic
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy, iambic
O no thy love though much is not so great, iambic
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake, iambic
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat, iambic
To play the watchman ever for thy sake, iambic
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere, iambic
From me far off with others all too near, iambic
Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye, iambic
And all my soul and all my every part, iambic
And for this sin there is no remedy, iambic
It is so grounded inward in my heart, iambic
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine, iambic
No shape so true no truth of such account, iambic
And for myself mine own worth do define, iambic
As I all other in all worths surmount, iambic
But when my glass shows me myself indeed, iambic
Beated and choppd with tannd antiquity, iambic
Mine own selflove quite contrary I read, iambic
Self so selfloving were iniquity, iambic
Tis thee myself that for myself I praise, iambic
Painting my age with beauty of thy days, iambic
Against my love shall be as I am now, iambic
With Times injurious hand crushd and oerworn, iambic
When hours have draind his blood and filld his brow, iambic
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn, iambic
Hath travelld on to ages steepy night, iambic
And all those beauties whereof now hes king, iambic
Are vanishing or vanishd out of sight, iambic
Stealing away the treasure of his spring, iambic
For such a time do I now fortify, iambic
Against confounding ages cruel knife, iambic
That he shall never cut from memory, iambic
My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life, iambic
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen, iambic
And they shall live and he in them still green, iambic
When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced, iambic
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age, iambic
When sometime lofty towers I see downrazed, iambic
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage, iambic
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain, iambic
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, iambic
And the firm soil win of the watery main, iambic
Increasing store with loss and loss with store, iambic
When I have seen such interchange of state, iambic
Or state itself confounded to decay, iambic
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate, iambic
That Time will come and take my love away, iambic
This thought is as a death which cannot choose, iambic
But weep to have that which it fears to lose, iambic
Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea, iambic
But sad mortality oersways their power, iambic
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, iambic
Whose action is no stronger than a flower, iambic
O how shall summers honey breath hold out, iambic
Against the wreckful siege of battering days, iambic
When rocks impregnable are not so stout, iambic
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays, iambic
O fearful meditation where alack, iambic
Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid, iambic
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back, iambic
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid, iambic
O none unless this miracle have might, iambic
That in black ink my love may still shine bright, iambic
Tired with all these for restful death I cry, iambic
As to behold desert a beggar born, iambic
And needy nothing trimmd in jollity, iambic
And purest faith unhappily forsworn, iambic
And guilded honour shamefully misplaced, iambic
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, iambic
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced, iambic
And strength by limping sway disabled, iambic
And art made tonguetied by authority, iambic
And folly doctorlike controlling skill, iambic
And simple truth miscalld simplicity, iambic
And captive good attending captain ill, iambic
Tired with all these from these would I be gone, iambic
Save that to die I leave my love alone, iambic
Ah wherefore with infection should he live, iambic
And with his presence grace impiety, iambic
That sin by him advantage should achieve, iambic
And lace itself with his society, iambic
Why should false painting imitate his cheek, iambic
And steal dead seeing of his living hue, iambic
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek, iambic
Roses of shadow since his rose is true, iambic
Why should he live now Nature bankrupt is, iambic
Beggard of blood to blush through lively veins, iambic
For she hath no exchequer now but his, iambic
And proud of many lives upon his gains, iambic
O him she stores to show what wealth she had, iambic
In days long since before these last so bad, iambic
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, iambic
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now, iambic
Before the bastard signs of fair were born, iambic
Or durst inhabit on a living brow, iambic
Before the golden tresses of the dead, iambic
The right of sepulchres were shorn away, iambic
To live a second life on second head, iambic
Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay, iambic
In him those holy antique hours are seen, iambic
Without all ornament itself and true, iambic
Making no summer of anothers green, iambic
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new, iambic
And him as for a map doth Nature store, iambic
To show false Art what beauty was of yore, iambic
Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view, iambic
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend, iambic
All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due, iambic
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend, iambic
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd, iambic
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own, iambic
In other accents do this praise confound, iambic
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown, iambic
They look into the beauty of thy mind, iambic
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds, iambic
Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind, iambic
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds, iambic
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show, iambic
The solve is this that thou dost common grow, iambic
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect, iambic
For slanders mark was ever yet the fair, iambic
The ornament of beauty is suspect, iambic
A crow that flies in heavens sweetest air, iambic
So thou be good slander doth but approve, iambic
Thy worth the greater being wood of time, iambic
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, iambic
And thou presentst a pure unstained prime, iambic
Thou hast passd by the ambush of young days, iambic
Either not assaild or victor being charged, iambic
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise, iambic
To tie up envy evermore enlarged, iambic
If some suspect of ill maskd not thy show, iambic
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe, iambic
No longer mourn for me when I am dead, iambic
Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell, iambic
Give warning to the world that I am fled, iambic
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell, iambic
Nay if you read this line remember not, iambic
The hand that writ it for I love you so, iambic
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, iambic
If thinking on me then should make you woe, iambic
O if I say you look upon this verse, iambic
When I perhaps compounded am with clay, iambic
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse, iambic
But let your love even with my life decay, iambic
Lest the wise world should look into your moan, iambic
And mock you with me after I am gone, iambic
O lest the world should task you to recite, iambic
What merit lived in me that you should love, iambic
After my death dear love forget me quite, iambic
For you in me can nothing worthy prove, iambic
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie, iambic
To do more for me than mine own desert, iambic
And hang more praise upon deceased I, iambic
Than niggard truth would willingly impart, iambic
O lest your true love may seem false in this, iambic
That you for love speak well of me untrue, iambic
My name be buried where my body is, iambic
And live no more to shame nor me nor you, iambic
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth, iambic
And so should you to love things nothing worth, iambic
That time of year thou mayst in me behold, iambic
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang, iambic
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, iambic
Bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang, iambic
In me thou seest the twilight of such day, iambic
As after sunset fadeth in the west, iambic
Which by and by black night doth take away, iambic
Deaths second self that seals up all in rest, iambic
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire, iambic
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, iambic
As the deathbed whereon it must expire, iambic
Consumed with that which it was nourishd by, iambic
This thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong, iambic
To love that well which thou must leave ere long, iambic
But be contented when that fell arrest, iambic
Without all bail shall carry me away, iambic
My life hath in this line some interest, iambic
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay, iambic
When thou reviewest this thou dost review, iambic
The very part was consecrate to thee, iambic
The earth can have but earth which is his due, iambic
My spirit is thine the better part of me, iambic
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, iambic
The prey of worms my body being dead, iambic
The coward conquest of a wretchs knife, iambic
Too base of thee to be remembered, iambic
The worth of that is that which it contains, iambic
And that is this and this with thee remains, iambic
So are you to my thoughts as food to life, iambic
Or as sweetseasond showers are to the ground, iambic
And for the peace of you I hold such strife, iambic
As twixt a miser and his wealth is found, iambic
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon, iambic
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure, iambic
Now counting best to be with you alone, iambic
Then betterd that the world may see my pleasure, iambic
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight, iambic
And by and by clean starved for a look, iambic
Possessing or pursuing no delight, iambic
Save what is had or must from you be took, iambic
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day, iambic
Or gluttoning on all or all away, iambic
Why is my verse so barren of new pride, iambic
So far from variation or quick change, iambic
Why with the time do I not glance aside, iambic
To newfound methods and to compounds strange, iambic
Why write I still all one ever the same, iambic
And keep invention in a noted weed, iambic
That every word doth almost tell my name, iambic
Showing their birth and where they did proceed, iambic
O know sweet love I always write of you, iambic
And you and love are still my argument, iambic
So all my best is dressing old words new, iambic
Spending again what is already spent, iambic
For as the sun is daily new and old, iambic
So is my love still telling what is told, iambic
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear, iambic
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste, iambic
The vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear, iambic
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste, iambic
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show, iambic
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory, iambic
Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know, iambic
Times thievish progress to eternity, iambic
Look what thy memory can not contain, iambic
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find, iambic
Those children nursed deliverd from thy brain, iambic
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind, iambic
These offices so oft as thou wilt look, iambic
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book, iambic
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse, iambic
And found such fair assistance in my verse, iambic
As every alien pen hath got my use, iambic
And under thee their poesy disperse, iambic
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing, iambic
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly, iambic
Have added feathers to the learneds wing, iambic
And given grace a double majesty, iambic
Yet be most proud of that which I compile, iambic
Whose influence is thine and born of thee, iambic
In others works thou dost but mend the style, iambic
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be, iambic
But thou art all my art and dost advance, iambic
As high as learning my rude ignorance, iambic
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid, iambic
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace, iambic
But now my gracious numbers are decayd, iambic
And my sick Muse doth give another place, iambic
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument, iambic
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen, iambic
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent, iambic
He robs thee of and pays it thee again, iambic
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word, iambic
From thy behavior beauty doth he give, iambic
And found it in thy cheek he can afford, iambic
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live, iambic
Then thank him not for that which he doth say, iambic
Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay, iambic
O how I faint when I of you do write, iambic
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name, iambic
And in the praise thereof spends all his might, iambic
To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame, iambic
But since your worth wide as the ocean is, iambic
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, iambic
My saucy bark inferior far to his, iambic
On your broad main doth wilfully appear, iambic
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat, iambic
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride, iambic
Or being wreckd I am a worthless boat, iambic
He of tall building and of goodly pride, iambic
Then if he thrive and I be cast away, iambic
The worst was this my love was my decay, iambic
Or I shall live your epitaph to make, iambic
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten, iambic
From hence your memory death cannot take, iambic
Although in me each part will be forgotten, iambic
Your name from hence immortal life shall have, iambic
Though I once gone to all the world must die, iambic
The earth can yield me but a common grave, iambic
When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie, iambic
Your monument shall be my gentle verse, iambic
Which eyes not yet created shall oerread, iambic
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse, iambic
When all the breathers of this world are dead, iambic
You still shall livesuch virtue hath my pen, iambic
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men, iambic
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse, iambic
And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook, iambic
The dedicated words which writers use, iambic
Of their fair subject blessing every book, iambic
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue, iambic
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise, iambic
And therefore art enforced to seek anew, iambic
Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days, iambic
And do so love yet when they have devised, iambic
What strained touches rhetoric can lend, iambic
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized, iambic
In true plain words by thy truetelling friend, iambic
And their gross painting might be better used, iambic
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused, iambic
I never saw that you did painting need, iambic
And therefore to your fair no painting set, iambic
I found or thought I found you did exceed, iambic
The barren tender of a poets debt, iambic
And therefore have I slept in your report, iambic
That you yourself being extant well might show, iambic
How far a modern quill doth come too short, iambic
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow, iambic
This silence for my sin you did impute, iambic
Which shall be most my glory being dumb, iambic
For I impair not beauty being mute, iambic
When others would give life and bring a tomb, iambic
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes, iambic
Than both your poets can in praise devise, iambic
Who is it that says most which can say more, iambic
Than this rich praise that you alone are you, iambic
In whose confine immured is the store, iambic
Which should example where your equal grew, iambic
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell, iambic
That to his subject lends not some small glory, iambic
But he that writes of you if he can tell, iambic
That you are you so dignifies his story, iambic
Let him but copy what in you is writ, iambic
Not making worse what nature made so clear, iambic
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit, iambic
Making his style admired every where, iambic
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse, iambic
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse, iambic
My tonguetied Muse in manners holds her still, iambic
While comments of your praise richly compiled, iambic
Reserve their character with golden quill, iambic
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed, iambic
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words, iambic
And like unletterd clerk still cry Amen, iambic
To every hymn that able spirit affords, iambic
In polishd form of wellrefined pen, iambic
Hearing you praised I say Tis so tis true, iambic
And to the most of praise add something more, iambic
But that is in my thought whose love to you, iambic
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before, iambic
Then others for the breath of words respect, iambic
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect, iambic
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse, iambic
Bound for the prize of all too precious you, iambic
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse, iambic
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew, iambic
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write, iambic
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead, iambic
No neither he nor his compeers by night, iambic
Giving him aid my verse astonished, iambic
He nor that affable familiar ghost, iambic
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence, iambic
As victors of my silence cannot boast, iambic
I was not sick of any fear from thence, iambic
But when your countenance filld up his line, iambic
Then lackd I matter that enfeebled mine, iambic
Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing, iambic
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate, iambic
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing, iambic
My bonds in thee are all determinate, iambic
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting, iambic
And for that riches where is my deserving, iambic
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, iambic
And so my patent back again is swerving, iambic
Thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing, iambic
Or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking, iambic
So thy great gift upon misprision growing, iambic
Comes home again on better judgment making, iambic
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter, iambic
In sleep a king but waking no such matter, iambic
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light, iambic
And place my merit in the eye of scorn, iambic
Upon thy side against myself Ill fight, iambic
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn, iambic
With mine own weakness being best acquainted, iambic
Upon thy part I can set down a story, iambic
Of faults conceald wherein I am attainted, iambic
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory, iambic
And I by this will be a gainer too, iambic
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee, iambic
The injuries that to myself I do, iambic
Doing thee vantage doublevantage me, iambic
Such is my love to thee I so belong, iambic
That for thy right myself will bear all wrong, iambic
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault, iambic
And I will comment upon that offence, iambic
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt, iambic
Against thy reasons making no defence, iambic
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill, iambic
To set a form upon desired change, iambic
As Ill myself disgrace knowing thy will, iambic
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange, iambic
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue, iambic
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, iambic
Lest I too much profane should do it wrong, iambic
And haply of our old acquaintance tell, iambic
For thee against myself Ill vow debate, iambic
For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate, iambic
Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now, iambic
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross, iambic
Join with the spite of fortune make me bow, iambic
And do not drop in for an afterloss, iambic
Ah do not when my heart hath scoped this sorrow, iambic
Come in the rearward of a conquerd woe, iambic
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow, iambic
To linger out a purposed overthrow, iambic
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last, iambic
When other petty griefs have done their spite, iambic
But in the onset come so shall I taste, iambic
At first the very worst of fortunes might, iambic
And other strains of woe which now seem woe, iambic
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so, iambic
Some glory in their birth some in their skill, iambic
Some in their wealth some in their bodies force, iambic
Some in their garments though newfangled ill, iambic
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse, iambic
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure, iambic
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest, iambic
But these particulars are not my measure, iambic
All these I better in one general best, iambic
Thy love is better than high birth to me, iambic
Richer than wealth prouder than garments cost, iambic
Of more delight than hawks or horses be, iambic
And having thee of all mens pride I boast, iambic
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take, iambic
All this away and me most wretched make, iambic
But do thy worst to steal thyself away, iambic
For term of life thou art assured mine, iambic
And life no longer than thy love will stay, iambic
For it depends upon that love of thine, iambic
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs, iambic
When in the least of them my life hath end, iambic
I see a better state to me belongs, iambic
Than that which on thy humour doth depend, iambic
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind, iambic
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie, iambic
O what a happy title do I find, iambic
Happy to have thy love happy to die, iambic
But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot, iambic
Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not, iambic
So shall I live supposing thou art true, iambic
Like a deceived husband so loves face, iambic
May still seem love to me though alterd new, iambic
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place, iambic
For there can live no hatred in thine eye, iambic
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change, iambic
In manys looks the false hearts history, iambic
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange, iambic
But heaven in thy creation did decree, iambic
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell, iambic
Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be, iambic
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell, iambic
How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow, iambic
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show, iambic
They that have power to hurt and will do none, iambic
That do not do the thing they most do show, iambic
Who moving others are themselves as stone, iambic
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow, iambic
They rightly do inherit heavens graces, iambic
And husband natures riches from expense, iambic
They are the lords and owners of their faces, iambic
Others but stewards of their excellence, iambic
The summers flower is to the summer sweet, iambic
Though to itself it only live and die, iambic
But if that flower with base infection meet, iambic
The basest weed outbraves his dignity, iambic
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds, iambic
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds, iambic
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame, iambic
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose, iambic
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name, iambic
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose, iambic
That tongue that tells the story of thy days, iambic
Making lascivious comments on thy sport, iambic
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise, iambic
Naming thy name blesses an ill report, iambic
O what a mansion have those vices got, iambic
Which for their habitation chose out thee, iambic
Where beautys veil doth cover every blot, iambic
And all things turn to fair that eyes can see, iambic
Take heed dear heart of this large privilege, iambic
The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge, iambic
Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness, iambic
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport, iambic
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less, iambic
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort, iambic
As on the finger of a throned queen, iambic
The basest jewel will be well esteemd, iambic
So are those errors that in thee are seen, iambic
To truths translated and for true things deemd, iambic
How many lambs might the stem wolf betray, iambic
If like a lamb he could his looks translate, iambic
How many gazers mightst thou lead away, iambic
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state, iambic
But do not so I love thee in such sort, iambic
As thou being mine mine is thy good report, iambic
How like a winter hath my absence been, iambic
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year, iambic
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen, iambic
What old Decembers bareness every where, iambic
And yet this time removed was summers time, iambic
The teeming autumn big with rich increase, iambic
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, iambic
Like widowd wombs after their lords decease, iambic
Yet this abundant issue seemd to me, iambic
But hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit, iambic
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee, iambic
And thou away the very birds are mute, iambic
Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer, iambic
That leaves look pale dreading the winters near, iambic
From you have I been absent in the spring, iambic
When proudpied April dressd in all his trim, iambic
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing, iambic
That heavy Saturn laughd and leapd with him, iambic
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell, iambic
Of different flowers in odour and in hue, iambic
Could make me any summers story tell, iambic
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew, iambic
Nor did I wonder at the lilys white, iambic
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose, iambic
They were but sweet but figures of delight, iambic
Drawn after you you pattern of all those, iambic
Yet seemd it winter still and you away, iambic
As with your shadow I with these did play, iambic
The forward violet thus did I chide, iambic
Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, iambic
If not from my loves breath The purple pride, iambic
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells, iambic
In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed, iambic
The lily I condemned for thy hand, iambic
And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair, iambic
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand, iambic
One blushing shame another white despair, iambic
A third nor red nor white had stoln of both, iambic
And to his robbery had annexd thy breath, iambic
But for his theft in pride of all his growth, iambic
A vengeful canker eat him up to death, iambic
More flowers I noted yet I none could see, iambic
But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee, iambic
Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long, iambic
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might, iambic
Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song, iambic
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light, iambic
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem, iambic
In gentle numbers time so idly spent, iambic
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem, iambic
And gives thy pen both skill and argument, iambic
Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey, iambic
If Time have any wrinkle graven there, iambic
If any be a satire to decay, iambic
And make Times spoils despised every where, iambic
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life, iambic
So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife, iambic
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends, iambic
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed, iambic
Both truth and beauty on my love depends, iambic
So dost thou too and therein dignified, iambic
Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say, iambic
Truth needs no colour with his colour fixd, iambic
Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay, iambic
But best is best if never intermixd, iambic
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb, iambic
Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee, iambic
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb, iambic
And to be praised of ages yet to be, iambic
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how, iambic
To make him seem long hence as he shows now, iambic
My love is strengthend though more weak in seeming, iambic
I love not less though less the show appear, iambic
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming, iambic
The owners tongue doth publish every where, iambic
Our love was new and then but in the spring, iambic
When I was wont to greet it with my lays, iambic
As Philomel in summers front doth sing, iambic
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days, iambic
Not that the summer is less pleasant now, iambic
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, iambic
But that wild music burthens every bough, iambic
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight, iambic
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue, iambic
Because I would not dull you with my song, iambic
Alack what poverty my Muse brings forth, iambic
That having such a scope to show her pride, iambic
The argument all bare is of more worth, iambic
Than when it hath my added praise beside, iambic
O blame me not if I no more can write, iambic
Look in your glass and there appears a face, iambic
That overgoes my blunt invention quite, iambic
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace, iambic
Were it not sinful then striving to mend, iambic
To mar the subject that before was well, iambic
For to no other pass my verses tend, iambic
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell, iambic
And more much more than in my verse can sit, iambic
Your own glass shows you when you look in it, iambic
To me fair friend you never can be old, iambic
For as you were when first your eye I eyed, iambic
Such seems your beauty still Three winters cold, iambic
Have from the forests shook three summers pride, iambic
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd, iambic
In process of the seasons have I seen, iambic
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burnd, iambic
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green, iambic
Ah yet doth beauty like a dialhand, iambic
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived, iambic
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand, iambic
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived, iambic
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred, iambic
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead, iambic
Let not my love be calld idolatry, iambic
Nor my beloved as an idol show, iambic
Since all alike my songs and praises be, iambic
To one of one still such and ever so, iambic
Kind is my love today tomorrow kind, iambic
Still constant in a wondrous excellence, iambic
Therefore my verse to constancy confined, iambic
One thing expressing leaves out difference, iambic
Fair kind and true is all my argument, iambic
Fair kind and true varying to other words, iambic
And in this change is my invention spent, iambic
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords, iambic
Fair kind and true have often lived alone, iambic
Which three till now never kept seat in one, iambic
When in the chronicle of wasted time, iambic
I see descriptions of the fairest wights, iambic
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme, iambic
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, iambic
Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best, iambic
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow, iambic
I see their antique pen would have expressd, iambic
Even such a beauty as you master now, iambic
So all their praises are but prophecies, iambic
Of this our time all you prefiguring, iambic
And for they lookd but with divining eyes, iambic
They had not skill enough your worth to sing, iambic
For we which now behold these present days, iambic
Had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise, iambic
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul, iambic
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come, iambic
Can yet the lease of my true love control, iambic
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom, iambic
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured, iambic
And the sad augurs mock their own presage, iambic
Incertainties now crown themselves assured, iambic
And peace proclaims olives of endless age, iambic
Now with the drops of this most balmy time, iambic
My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes, iambic
Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme, iambic
While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes, iambic
And thou in this shalt find thy monument, iambic
When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent, iambic
Whats in the brain that ink may character, iambic
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit, iambic
Whats new to speak what new to register, iambic
That may express my love or thy dear merit, iambic
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine, iambic
I must each day say oer the very same, iambic
Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine, iambic
Even as when first I hallowd thy fair name, iambic
So that eternal love in loves fresh case, iambic
Weighs not the dust and injury of age, iambic
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place, iambic
But makes antiquity for aye his page, iambic
Finding the first conceit of love there bred, iambic
Where time and outward form would show it dead, iambic
O never say that I was false of heart, iambic
Though absence seemd my flame to qualify, iambic
As easy might I from myself depart, iambic
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie, iambic
That is my home of love if I have ranged, iambic
Like him that travels I return again, iambic
Just to the time not with the time exchanged, iambic
So that myself bring water for my stain, iambic
Never believe though in my nature reignd, iambic
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood, iambic
That it could so preposterously be staind, iambic
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good, iambic
For nothing this wide universe I call, iambic
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all, iambic
Alas tis true I have gone here and there, iambic
And made myself a motley to the view, iambic
Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear, iambic
Made old offences of affections new, iambic
Most true it is that I have lookd on truth, iambic
Askance and strangely but by all above, iambic
These blenches gave my heart another youth, iambic
And worse essays proved thee my best of love, iambic
Now all is done have what shall have no end, iambic
Mine appetite I never more will grind, iambic
On newer proof to try an older friend, iambic
A god in love to whom I am confined, iambic
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best, iambic
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast, iambic
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide, iambic
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, iambic
That did not better for my life provide, iambic
Than public means which public manners breeds, iambic
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, iambic
And almost thence my nature is subdued, iambic
To what it works in like the dyers hand, iambic
Pity me then and wish I were renewd, iambic
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink, iambic
Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection, iambic
No bitterness that I will bitter think, iambic
Nor double penance to correct correction, iambic
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye, iambic
Even that your pity is enough to cure me, iambic
Your love and pity doth the impression fill, iambic
Which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow, iambic
For what care I who calls me well or ill, iambic
So you oergreen my bad my good allow, iambic
You are my all the world and I must strive, iambic
To know my shames and praises from your tongue, iambic
None else to me nor I to none alive, iambic
That my steeld sense or changes right or wrong, iambic
In so profound abysm I throw all care, iambic
Of others voices that my adders sense, iambic
To critic and to flatterer stopped are, iambic
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense, iambic
You are so strongly in my purpose bred, iambic
That all the world besides methinks are dead, iambic
Since I left you mine eye is in my mind, iambic
And that which governs me to go about, iambic
Doth part his function and is partly blind, iambic
Seems seeing but effectually is out, iambic
For it no form delivers to the heart, iambic
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch, iambic
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part, iambic
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch, iambic
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight, iambic
The most sweet favour or deformedst creature, iambic
The mountain or the sea the day or night, iambic
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature, iambic
Incapable of more replete with you, iambic
My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue, iambic
Or whether doth my mind being crownd with you, iambic
Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery, iambic
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true, iambic
And that your love taught it this alchemy, iambic
To make of monsters and things indigest, iambic
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, iambic
Creating every bad a perfect best, iambic
As fast as objects to his beams assemble, iambic
Otis the first tis flattery in my seeing, iambic
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up, iambic
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing, iambic
And to his palate doth prepare the cup, iambic
If it be poisond tis the lesser sin, iambic
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin, iambic
Those lines that I before have writ do lie, iambic
Even those that said I could not love you dearer, iambic
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why, iambic
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer, iambic
But reckoning time whose milliond accidents, iambic
Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings, iambic
Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents, iambic
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things, iambic
Alas why fearing of times tyranny, iambic
Might I not then say Now I love you best, iambic
When I was certain oer incertainty, iambic
Crowning the present doubting of the rest, iambic
Love is a babe then might I not say so, iambic
To give full growth to that which still doth grow, iambic
Let me not to the marriage of true minds, iambic
Admit impediments Love is not love, iambic
Which alters when it alteration finds, iambic
Or bends with the remover to remove, iambic
O no it is an everfixed mark, iambic
That looks on tempests and is never shaken, iambic
It is the star to every wandering bark, iambic
Whose worths unknown although his height be taken, iambic
Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks, iambic
Within his bending sickles compass come, iambic
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, iambic
But bears it out even to the edge of doom, iambic
If this be error and upon me proved, iambic
I never writ nor no man ever loved, iambic
Accuse me thus that I have scanted all, iambic
Wherein I should your great deserts repay, iambic
Forgot upon your dearest love to call, iambic
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day, iambic
That I have frequent been with unknown minds, iambic
And given to time your own dearpurchased right, iambic
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds, iambic
Which should transport me farthest from your sight, iambic
Book both my wilfulness and errors down, iambic
And on just proof surmise accumulate, iambic
Bring me within the level of your frown, iambic
But shoot not at me in your wakend hate, iambic
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove, iambic
The constancy and virtue of your love, iambic
Like as to make our appetites more keen, iambic
With eager compounds we our palate urge, iambic
As to prevent our maladies unseen, iambic
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge, iambic
Even so being tuff of your neercloying sweetness, iambic
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding, iambic
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness, iambic
To be diseased ere that there was true needing, iambic
Thus policy in love to anticipate, iambic
The ills that were not grew to faults assured, iambic
And brought to medicine a healthful state, iambic
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured, iambic
But thence I learn and find the lesson true, iambic
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you, iambic
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears, iambic
Distilld from limbecks foul as hell within, iambic
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears, iambic
Still losing when I saw myself to win, iambic
What wretched errors hath my heart committed, iambic
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never, iambic
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted, iambic
In the distraction of this madding fever, iambic
O benefit of ill now I find true, iambic
That better is by evil still made better, iambic
And ruind love when it is built anew, iambic
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater, iambic
So I return rebuked to my content, iambic
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent, iambic
That you were once unkind befriends me now, iambic
And for that sorrow which I then did feel, iambic
Needs must I under my transgression bow, iambic
Unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel, iambic
For if you were by my unkindness shaken, iambic
As I by yours youve passd a hell of time, iambic
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken, iambic
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime, iambic
O that our night of woe might have rememberd, iambic
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits, iambic
And soon to you as you to me then tenderd, iambic
The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits, iambic
But that your trespass now becomes a fee, iambic
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me, iambic
Tis better to be vile than vile esteemd, iambic
When not to be receives reproach of being, iambic
And the just pleasure lost which is so deemd, iambic
Not by our feeling but by others seeing, iambic
For why should others false adulterate eyes, iambic
Give salutation to my sportive blood, iambic
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies, iambic
Which in their wills count bad what I think good, iambic
No I am that I am and they that level, iambic
At my abuses reckon up their own, iambic
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel, iambic
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown, iambic
Unless this general evil they maintain, iambic
All men are bad and in their badness reign, iambic
Thy gift thy tables are within my brain, iambic
Full characterd with lasting memory, iambic
Which shall above that idle rank remain, iambic
Beyond all date even to eternity, iambic
Or at the least so long as brain and heart, iambic
Have faculty by nature to subsist, iambic
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part, iambic
Of thee thy record never can be missd, iambic
That poor retention could not so much hold, iambic
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score, iambic
Therefore to give them from me was I bold, iambic
To trust those tables that receive thee more, iambic
To keep an adjunct to remember thee, iambic
Were to import forgetfulness in me, iambic
No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change, iambic
Thy pyramids built up with newer might, iambic
To me are nothing novel nothing strange, iambic
They are but dressings of a former sight, iambic
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire, iambic
What thou dost foist upon us that is old, iambic
And rather make them born to our desire, iambic
Than think that we before have heard them told, iambic
Thy registers and thee I both defy, iambic
Not wondering at the present nor the past, iambic
For thy records and what we see doth lie, iambic
Made more or less by thy continual haste, iambic
This I do vow and this shall ever be, iambic
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee, iambic
If my dear love were but the child of state, iambic
It might for Fortunes bastard be unfatherd, iambic
As subject to Times love or to Times hate, iambic
Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gatherd, iambic
No it was builded far from accident, iambic
It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls, iambic
Under the blow of thralled discontent, iambic
Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls, iambic
It fears not policy that heretic, iambic
Which works on leases of shortnumberd hours, iambic
But all alone stands hugely politic, iambic
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers, iambic
To this I witness call the fools of time, iambic
Which die for goodness who have lived for crime, iambic
Were t aught to me I bore the canopy, iambic
With my extern the outward honouring, iambic
Or laid great bases for eternity, iambic
Which prove more short than waste or ruining, iambic
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour, iambic
Lose all and more by paying too much rent, iambic
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour, iambic
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent, iambic
No let me be obsequious in thy heart, iambic
And take thou my oblation poor but free, iambic
Which is not mixd with seconds knows no art, iambic
But mutual render only me for thee, iambic
Hence thou subornd informer a true soul, iambic
When most impeachd stands least in thy control, iambic
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power, iambic
Dost hold Times fickle glass his sickle hour, iambic
Who hast by waning grown and therein showst, iambic
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst, iambic
If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack, iambic
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back, iambic
She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill, iambic
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill, iambic
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure, iambic
She may detain but not still keep her treasure, iambic
Her audit though delayd answerd must be, iambic
And her quietus is to render thee, iambic
In the old age black was not counted fair, iambic
Or if it were it bore not beautys name, iambic
But now is black beautys successive heir, iambic
And beauty slanderd with a bastard shame, iambic
For since each hand hath put on natures power, iambic
Fairing the foul with arts false borrowd face, iambic
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower, iambic
But is profaned if not lives in disgrace, iambic
Therefore my mistress brows are raven black, iambic
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem, iambic
At such who not born fair no beauty lack, iambic
Slandering creation with a false esteem, iambic
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe, iambic
That every tongue says beauty should look so, iambic
How oft when thou my music music playst, iambic
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds, iambic
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst, iambic
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds, iambic
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap, iambic
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand, iambic
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap, iambic
At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand, iambic
To be so tickled they would change their state, iambic
And situation with those dancing chips, iambic
Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait, iambic
Making dead wood more blest than living lips, iambic
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this, iambic
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss, iambic
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame, iambic
Is lust in action and till action lust, iambic
Is perjured murderous bloody full of blame, iambic
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust, iambic
Enjoyd no sooner but despised straight, iambic
Past reason hunted and no sooner had, iambic
Past reason hated as a swallowd bait, iambic
On purpose laid to make the taker mad, iambic
Mad in pursuit and in possession so, iambic
Had having and in quest to have extreme, iambic
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe, iambic
Before a joy proposed behind a dream, iambic
All this the world well knows yet none knows well, iambic
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell, iambic
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun, iambic
Coral is far more red than her lips red, iambic
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun, iambic
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head, iambic
I have seen roses damaskd red and white, iambic
But no such roses see I in her cheeks, iambic
And in some perfumes is there more delight, iambic
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks, iambic
I love to hear her speak yet well I know, iambic
That music hath a far more pleasing sound, iambic
I grant I never saw a goddess go, iambic
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground, iambic
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare, iambic
As any she belied with false compare, iambic
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art, iambic
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel, iambic
For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart, iambic
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel, iambic
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold, iambic
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan, iambic
To say they err I dare not be so bold, iambic
Although I swear it to myself alone, iambic
And to be sure that is not false I swear, iambic
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face, iambic
One on anothers neck do witness bear, iambic
Thy black is fairest in my judgments place, iambic
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds, iambic
And thence this slander as I think proceeds, iambic
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me, iambic
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain, iambic
Have put on black and loving mourners be, iambic
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain, iambic
And truly not the morning sun of heaven, iambic
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, iambic
Nor that full star that ushers in the even, iambic
Doth half that glory to the sober west, iambic
As those two mourning eyes become thy face, iambic
O let it then as well beseem thy heart, iambic
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace, iambic
And suit thy pity like in every part, iambic
Then will I swear beauty herself is black, iambic
And all they foul that thy complexion lack, iambic
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan, iambic
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me, iambic
Ist not enough to torture me alone, iambic
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be, iambic
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken, iambic
And my next self thou harder hast engrossd, iambic
Of him myself and thee I am forsaken, iambic
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd, iambic
Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward, iambic
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail, iambic
Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard, iambic
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol, iambic
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee, iambic
Perforce am thine and all that is in me, iambic
So now I have confessd that he is thine, iambic
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will, iambic
Myself Ill forfeit so that other mine, iambic
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still, iambic
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free, iambic
For thou art covetous and he is kind, iambic
He learnd but suretylike to write for me, iambic
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind, iambic
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, iambic
Thou usurer that putst forth all to use, iambic
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake, iambic
So him I lose through my unkind abuse, iambic
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me, iambic
He pays the whole and yet am I not free, iambic
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy Will, iambic
And Will to boot and Will in overplus, iambic
More than enough am I that vex thee still, iambic
To thy sweet will making addition thus, iambic
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious, iambic
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine, iambic
Shall will in others seem right gracious, iambic
And in my will no fair acceptance shine, iambic
The sea all water yet receives rain still, iambic
And in abundance addeth to his store, iambic
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will, iambic
One will of mine to make thy large Will more, iambic
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill, iambic
Think all but one and me in that one Will, iambic
If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near, iambic
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will, iambic
And will thy soul knows is admitted there, iambic
Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil, iambic
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love, iambic
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one, iambic
In things of great receipt with ease we prove, iambic
Among a number one is reckond none, iambic
Then in the number let me pass untold, iambic
Though in thy stores account I one must be, iambic
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold, iambic
That nothing me a something sweet to thee, iambic
Make but my name thy love and love that still, iambic
And then thou lovest me for my name is Will, iambic
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes, iambic
That they behold and see not what they see, iambic
They know what beauty is see where it lies, iambic
Yet what the best is take the worst to be, iambic
If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks, iambic
Be anchord in the bay where all men ride, iambic
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks, iambic
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied, iambic
Why should my heart think that a several plot, iambic
Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place, iambic
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not, iambic
To put fair truth upon so foul a face, iambic
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred, iambic
And to this false plague are they now transferrd, iambic
When my love swears that she is made of truth, iambic
I do believe her though I know she lies, iambic
That she might think me some untutord youth, iambic
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties, iambic
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young, iambic
Although she knows my days are past the best, iambic
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue, iambic
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressd, iambic
But wherefore says she not she is unjust, iambic
And wherefore say not I that I am old, iambic
O loves best habit is in seeming trust, iambic
And age in love loves not to have years told, iambic
Therefore I lie with her and she with me, iambic
And in our faults by lies we flatterd be, iambic
O call not me to justify the wrong, iambic
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart, iambic
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue, iambic
Use power with power and slay me not by art, iambic
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight, iambic
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside, iambic
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might, iambic
Is more than my oerpressd defense can bide, iambic
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows, iambic
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies, iambic
And therefore from my face she turns my foes, iambic
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries, iambic
Yet do not so but since I am near slain, iambic
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain, iambic
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press, iambic
My tonguetied patience with too much disdain, iambic
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express, iambic
The manner of my pitywanting pain, iambic
If I might teach thee wit better it were, iambic
Though not to love yet love to tell me so, iambic
As testy sick men when their deaths be near, iambic
No news but health from their physicians know, iambic
For if I should despair I should grow mad, iambic
And in my madness might speak ill of thee, iambic
Now this illwresting world is grown so bad, iambic
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be, iambic
That I may not be so nor thou belied, iambic
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide, iambic
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes, iambic
For they in thee a thousand errors note, iambic
But tis my heart that loves what they despise, iambic
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote, iambic
Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted, iambic
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone, iambic
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited, iambic
To any sensual feast with thee alone, iambic
But my five wits nor my five senses can, iambic
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee, iambic
Who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man, iambic
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be, iambic
Only my plague thus far I count my gain, iambic
That she that makes me sin awards me pain, iambic
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate, iambic
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving, iambic
O but with mine compare thou thine own state, iambic
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving, iambic
Or if it do not from those lips of thine, iambic
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments, iambic
And seald false bonds of love as oft as mine, iambic
Robbd others beds revenues of their rents, iambic
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovest those, iambic
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee, iambic
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows, iambic
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be, iambic
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide, iambic
By selfexample mayst thou be denied, iambic
Lo as a careful housewife runs to catch, iambic
One of her featherd creatures broke away, iambic
Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch, iambic
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay, iambic
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase, iambic
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent, iambic
To follow that which flies before her face, iambic
Not prizing her poor infants discontent, iambic
So runnst thou after that which flies from thee, iambic
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind, iambic
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me, iambic
And play the mothers part kiss me be kind, iambic
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will, iambic
If thou turn back and my loud crying still, iambic
Two loves I have of comfort and despair, iambic
Which like two spirits do suggest me still, iambic
The better angel is a man right fair, iambic
The worser spirit a woman colourd ill, iambic
To win me soon to hell my female evil, iambic
Tempteth my better angel from my side, iambic
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil, iambic
Wooing his purity with her foul pride, iambic
And whether that my angel be turnd fiend, iambic
Suspect I may but not directly tell, iambic
But being both from me both to each friend, iambic
I guess one angel in anothers hell, iambic
Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt, iambic
Till my bad angel fire my good one out, iambic
Those lips that Loves own hand did make, iambic
Breathed forth the sound that said I hate, iambic
To me that languishd for her sake, iambic
But when she saw my woeful state, iambic
Straight in her heart did mercy come, iambic
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet, iambic
Was used in giving gentle doom, iambic
And taught it thus anew to greet, iambic
I hate she alterd with an end, iambic
That followd it as gentle day, iambic
Doth follow night who like a fiend, iambic
From heaven to hell is flown away, iambic
I hate from hate away she threw, iambic
And saved my life saying not you, iambic
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth, iambic
these rebel powers that thee array, iambic
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth, iambic
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay, iambic
Why so large cost having so short a lease, iambic
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend, iambic
Shall worms inheritors of this excess, iambic
Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end, iambic
Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss, iambic
And let that pine to aggravate thy store, iambic
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross, iambic
Within be fed without be rich no more, iambic
So shalt thou feed on Death that feeds on men, iambic
And Death once dead theres no more dying then, iambic
My love is as a fever longing still, iambic
For that which longer nurseth the disease, iambic
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, iambic
The uncertain sickly appetite to please, iambic
My reason the physician to my love, iambic
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept, iambic
Hath left me and I desperate now approve, iambic
Desire is death which physic did except, iambic
Past cure I am now reason is past care, iambic
And franticmad with evermore unrest, iambic
My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are, iambic
At random from the truth vainly expressd, iambic
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright, iambic
Who art as black as hell as dark as night, iambic
O me what eyes hath Love put in my head, iambic
Which have no correspondence with true sight, iambic
Or if they have where is my judgment fled, iambic
That censures falsely what they see aright, iambic
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote, iambic
What means the world to say it is not so, iambic
If it be not then love doth well denote, iambic
Loves eye is not so true as all mens No, iambic
How can it O how can Loves eye be true, iambic
That is so vexd with watching and with tears, iambic
No marvel then though I mistake my view, iambic
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears, iambic
O cunning Love with tears thou keepst me blind, iambic
Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find, iambic
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not, iambic
When I against myself with thee partake, iambic
Do I not think on thee when I forgot, iambic
Am of myself all tyrant for thy sake, iambic
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend, iambic
On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon, iambic
Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend, iambic
Revenge upon myself with present moan, iambic
What merit do I in myself respect, iambic
That is so proud thy service to despise, iambic
When all my best doth worship thy defect, iambic
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes, iambic
But love hate on for now I know thy mind, iambic
Those that can see thou lovest and I am blind, iambic
O from what power hast thou this powerful might, iambic
With insufficiency my heart to sway, iambic
To make me give the lie to my true sight, iambic
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day, iambic
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill, iambic
That in the very refuse of thy deeds, iambic
There is such strength and warrantize of skill, iambic
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds, iambic
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more, iambic
The more I hear and see just cause of hate, iambic
O though I love what others do abhor, iambic
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state, iambic
If thy unworthiness raised love in me, iambic
More worthy I to be beloved of thee, iambic
Love is too young to know what conscience is, iambic
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love, iambic
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss, iambic
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove, iambic
For thou betraying me I do betray, iambic
My nobler part to my gross bodys treason, iambic
My soul doth tell my body that he may, iambic
Triumph in love flesh stays no father reason, iambic
But rising at thy name doth point out thee, iambic
As his triumphant prize Proud of this pride, iambic
He is contented thy poor drudge to be, iambic
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side, iambic
No want of conscience hold it that I call, iambic
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall, iambic
In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn, iambic
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing, iambic
In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn, iambic
In vowing new hate after new love bearing, iambic
But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee, iambic
When I break twenty I am perjured most, iambic
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee, iambic
And all my honest faith in thee is lost, iambic
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness, iambic
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy, iambic
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness, iambic
Or made them swear against the thing they see, iambic
For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I, iambic
To swear against the truth so foul a lie, iambic
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep, iambic
A maid of Dians this advantage found, iambic
And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep, iambic
In a cold valleyfountain of that ground, iambic
Which borrowd from this holy fire of Love, iambic
A dateless lively heat still to endure, iambic
And grew a seething bath which yet men prove, iambic
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure, iambic
But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired, iambic
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast, iambic
I sick withal the help of bath desired, iambic
And thither hied a sad distemperd guest, iambic
But found no cure the bath for my help lies, iambic
Where Cupid got new firemy mistress eyes, iambic
The little Lovegod lying once asleep, iambic
Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand, iambic
Whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep, iambic
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand, iambic
The fairest votary took up that fire, iambic
Which many legions of true hearts had warmd, iambic
And so the general of hot desire, iambic
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmd, iambic
This brand she quenched in a cool well by, iambic
Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual, iambic
Growing a bath and healthful remedy, iambic
For men diseased but I my mistress thrall, iambic
Came there for cure and this by that I prove, iambic
Loves fire heats water water cools not love, iambic
Come to me and put thine sweet eyes, anapaest
to put slander within my mind, anapaest
of the old and bad trite stale kind, anapaest
What false lines do impinge thy name, anapaest
the well known Lord and Lady Blare, anapaest
Such words I will not yea believe, anapaest
since without gens how they deceive, anapaest
The hot fire of this flames flambeau, anapaest
will burn scurrilous page I know, anapaest
Then with glaive on this pole Ill take, anapaest
their head clean off for they names sake, anapaest
I recall to our life when she came, anapaest
And for long years few knew who she was, anapaest
Two decades and more still theres oerload, anapaest
Of mega bits and bytes thrown to us, anapaest
And what a contradiction it is, anapaest
No one has refrained from sharing views, anapaest
And I oft feel ignorance is Zen, anapaest
But today it might drown us in doubt, anapaest
Time there was when it seemed our asset, anapaest
Such is shy maidens felicity, anapaest
But mired with opinions dressed as lie, anapaest
So enchanted was Sun by Queen Sea, anapaest
as he sat near some clouds high above, anapaest
he began sliding down stealthily, anapaest
till he touched the dark face of his love, anapaest
Then a third lover looked on the face, anapaest
rosy heavens with deep purple lace, anapaest
Night embraced lovely Sea Sun was gone, anapaest
Such poor plight how can forever conceal , anapaest
Who will write future in black and white , anapaest
This surveyed, anapaest
In solitude, anapaest
Acquainted  , anapaest
I must look very deep in my soul, anapaest
That will help me get close to my goal, anapaest
Clear I see as a child I was free, anapaest
Brought to church I was taught God to love, anapaest
Down a path that would lead to above, anapaest
For my heart and my soul lived for God, anapaest
Knowing he was my staff and my rod, anapaest
Now my hate strongly started to burn, anapaest
All this hate in me screamed set me free, anapaest
I am saved by his grace every day, anapaest
Im at peace and my spirit is free, anapaest
Free to fly with these wings God gave me, anapaest
I will dread Octobers spell, anapaest
It only comes but once a year, anapaest
But mummys cell phone gets a tweet, anapaest
she gets unraveled in the sheets, anapaest
and from the gauze that trips her feet , anapaest
Ghouls in shadows want to play, anapaest
Does he stand a ghost of chance, anapaest
To take her to the midnight dance, anapaest
Our cat has groomed her black coat sleek, anapaest
then hops upon the fence to sneak, anapaest
a peek into the living room, anapaest
where Dad weaves magic like a goon, anapaest
Embarrassed is a family clan, anapaest
They toss his magic in the can, anapaest
A wartnosed witch gets on her broom, anapaest
but preteen feet cant fly or zoom , anapaest
until she cleans her messy room, anapaest
The bedrooms cleaned with spit and shine, anapaest
While brother dares to take his time, anapaest
He plans to fill his sisters bag, anapaest
With tasty toads and wormy slime, anapaest
I hide and dread the harvest moon, anapaest
All Hollows Eve is coming soon, anapaest
I thought Id write some poetry, anapaest
Just for the fun that it would be, anapaest
So I went to the web to see, anapaest
 what it said, anapaest
about how to write poems just for me, anapaest
I ran into words like iambic and tercet, anapaest
and other ones that I had never met   , anapaest
There was even a thing called a quatrain, anapaest
that confused and corrupted my brain, anapaest
Stanzas are neat if they get the right beat, anapaest
with the meter which Id no doubt delete, anapaest
You also have tetrameter and pentameter, anapaest
which are terms I dont think are neat, anapaest
Long ago I did write in rhyme , anapaest
but just to friends who didnt mind, anapaest
Id write some limericks or lyrics to sing, anapaest
that were not important , anapaest
and didnt mean a thing, anapaest
But as I write now and look into how, anapaest
I find myself stymied by words to allow, anapaest
I read such things as trochee , anapaest
and anapest and even dactyl, anapaest
They are words I just read , anapaest
and dont really feel, anapaest
 a measure in feet, anapaest
With stresses on heavy or light, anapaest
and then they repeat, anapaest
They do form the meter , anapaest
which makes the poem complete, anapaest
I may just give up and write more in prose, anapaest
My friends will give thanks and Id smell like a rose, anapaest
But I do get such joy with the lines in a verse, anapaest
which doesnt make sense , anapaest
and just makes it worse, anapaest
Free verse would just boggle my mind, anapaest
It really wont matter, anapaest
what rules I would shatter, anapaest
as long as I make the words rhyme, anapaest
Limerick Gimmerick, anapaest
Jason of Pendleton, anapaest
Tried doubledactyls while, anapaest
Fearing the worst, anapaest
Uhohspaghettio, anapaest
Theyre all bassackwards cuz, anapaest
Hes used to anapest, anapaest
An Old Goat in a boat rowed off shore, anapaest
He caught perch in his search and much more, anapaest
theres trout in his coat, anapaest
Eau de fish was his scent evermore, anapaest
How they laugh and they point as they whisper bout me, anapaest
And they only can see what their shallow eyes see, anapaest
Though my surface is not picture perfect for show, anapaest
How this heart bleeds with purpose they never could know, anapaest
Of the horrors and trials my soul has survived, anapaest
Of the hell and the fury that killed me alive, anapaest
Ive been stripped of my honor and burnt at the stake, anapaest
Made to live in a nightmare but could not awake, anapaest
The atrocities bared on my face in display, anapaest
Oh they cause you to cringe as your eyes turn away, anapaest
And the truth is my scars are much deeper than face, anapaest
Just a trace has been left of humanitys grace, anapaest
As they came in the dead of the night whilst we slept, anapaest
Through the house down the hall they so silently crept, anapaest
I was tied to a chair and with sickened disgust, anapaest
Made to watch as my daughters defiled with their lust, anapaest
Oh my sweet baby girls who I failed to protect, anapaest
Now your innocence lives in my heart where youre kept, anapaest
As the flames and your screams took the last of my peace, anapaest
Melting skin joined my tears as your souls found release, anapaest
Fall the leaves of the forest tho death has yet passed , anapaest
Unto moonlit shadows within crypts hidden rot , anapaest
Oh but lo To the truth they are blind it is naught, anapaest
Theyre but fragmented feelings of love left aghast , anapaest
From her heart they were torn bits he stabbed then forgot , anapaest
The shadows cannot hide nor contain the scars wrought , anapaest
Left to wander until retribution is brought, anapaest
As the sky bleeds to twilight  the sweetest disease, anapaest
As a warm breeze courts Eros at twilights advance, anapaest
Till a feverish tango as all reason halts, anapaest
As the world falls from focus in dizzying strides , anapaest
Should the moon cast its toxin on amorous souls, anapaest
The subject at hand will be somewhat informal, anapaest
I wonder each day what will be the new normal, anapaest
to find some brand new locks growing out of my ear, anapaest
And what of tomorrow morning when I awake, anapaest
Will I find a limb afflicted with a strange ache, anapaest
Will the pharmacy have some great cream or a pill, anapaest
to assuage sudden change brought on by my ill, anapaest
I have chosen to find humor rather than stress, anapaest
to keep our lives routine will cost us more money, anapaest
to the edge of horizons and harmonys light, anapaest
comes warm smiles to be found on the face of our hearts, anapaest
this rapture so vibrant from the wealth of loves eyes, anapaest
was released and was felt when we cut through its veils , anapaest
to invite a new world to be filled with lifes needs, anapaest
and claim peace from the soul with the years to be shared, anapaest
to welcome the mornings when the light rushes free, anapaest
and hinges on eyelids come open to adore, anapaest
the lovely jewels held in the life well treasure, anapaest
as we move through the days with a blissful intent, anapaest
when time becomes fleeting and the days become nights, anapaest
unaware of the world and the time to have passed  , anapaest
to spend our emotions when love found us worthy, anapaest
this payment to be made with the lips breathless kiss, anapaest
I was lost as the night wrapped its ebony shades, anapaest
round your lips like the petals on roses unfurled, anapaest
left me hopeless to shun a temptation like this, anapaest
though aware of the thorns and the danger they posed, anapaest
so I reached for your love and I bled and I cried, anapaest
as I danced through the stems of your past and your life, anapaest
and was freed from my own hidden garden of pain, anapaest
A poet was making such clatter, anapaest
His friend ran to see whats the matter, anapaest
or my poems cant be, anapaest
in Antiseptic Pentameter, anapaest
His friend laughed at all of the chatter, anapaest
The other didnt grasp the matter, anapaest
so your poems will be, anapaest
in Antipasto Pentameter, anapaest
My problem with glutens the matter, anapaest
and why I must make so much clatter, anapaest
Im allergic you see, anapaest
Id get shakes and would be, anapaest
writing in Spastic Pentameter, anapaest
In a prayer anapestic, anapaest
this form was to tick, anapaest
Tis the day after Christmas the house is a mess, anapaest
When will they restore order Thats anyones guess, anapaest
This familys sluggish and tired as can be, anapaest
seven veggies    Mom will use her skills to disguise, anapaest
all thats left Shell transform it and serve it for days, anapaest
Daddy slips to the den to his favorite chair, anapaest
for a short winters napthen sees Mom standing there, anapaest
Then a big pile of invoices for us awaits, anapaest
We will pay them online Now is no time to doze, anapaest
Then up from the recliner poor pooped Dad arose, anapaest
I can see them but often are blurs undefined, anapaest
I can see them in beauty of lifes sweet ballet, anapaest
every new day unfolds with its bright morning ray, anapaest
in their river of insights where artistry streams, anapaest
inspiration flows from them in glorious beams, anapaest
Gods most beautiful creatures of angels help me, anapaest
angel love and directionsunup till sundown, anapaest
angel love and directionsunup till sundown, anapaest
I cannot say how poems come to be, anapaest
they come into my mind amazingly, anapaest
I cannot say how I hunt down my words, anapaest
Or then select a form to fit the theme, anapaest
Or count the syllables for metered flow, anapaest
select the feet of two or more to show, anapaest
that make the words behave or wildly prance, anapaest
to then rewrite and add what I forgot, anapaest
I cannot say how poems come to be, anapaest
they come into my mind amazingly, anapaest
is an awesome reserve of a pot filled with gold, anapaest
in the form of gold coins to use up selfishly, anapaest
theyll be wishes come true deep within to allot, anapaest
Like a resolute peace in each country on Earth, anapaest
Find the cure for diseasestheir mysteries solved, anapaest
so the curse of these monsters is truly dissolved, anapaest
Find a way to stop hunger both here and abroad, anapaest
make new laws so that violence does not erupt, anapaest
with her laws keep in sync in whatever we do, anapaest
theyll be wishes come true for mankind to behold, anapaest
   the first child with a brother who followed in time, anapaest
   and my teachers took time to encourage my urge, anapaest
I enjoyed my young years while I painted and penned, anapaest
   lots of canvas and paper used up without end, anapaest
   and enjoyed my new path of becoming a wife, anapaest
We worked hard every day and our life was so good, anapaest
   I wrote poems and painted whenever I could, anapaest
   and I studied six years at an art gallery, anapaest
   I enrolled in a college to study parttime, anapaest
   a BAand a Minor in Business for me, anapaest
   and I soon published poems of life and of heart, anapaest
Yet along in this time of my great writing spree, anapaest
  I worked hard every day as our business VP, anapaest
Our dear children all married with families too, anapaest
   are involved happily in whatever they do, anapaest
   and one granddaughter married two thousand thirteen, anapaest
We are proud and so blessed and thank God up above, anapaest
   for our days and our life of good times filled with love, anapaest
But to my big surprise when that contest was done, anapaest
My sad eyes saw in fact that my poem had not won, anapaest
Could not find what it meant anywhere on the site, anapaest
My head spun to fit in which of these it could be, anapaest
Now I still do not know what NA represents, anapaest
When your poem doesnt win in Soup contest events, anapaest
I give praise and respect to the Christ, anapaest
His good grace as I ask  is a win, anapaest
In no way does no price mean no cost, anapaest
For Gods mercys a gift He presents, anapaest
for eternity  wasted expense, anapaest
The real cost for our Lord was His blood, anapaest
And our God sends His Spirit to flood, anapaest
the new life with the powr of the cross, anapaest
Sins a breach between man and his God, anapaest
He deserves no mere shallow embrace, anapaest
No believer with simply a nod, anapaest
understands the full cost of His grace, anapaest
does a friendship with God eer begin, anapaest
Jesus Christ wants obedience now, anapaest
than to lay down your life for your friend, anapaest
we set off on excursions within that domain, anapaest
we began at a loss, anapaest
We embark on a most unpredictable task , anapaest
touring Cadillac Mountain with fog as a mask , anapaest
by creating a fuss, anapaest
up the fiftytwo steps to attend to our need, anapaest
we by chance run across, anapaest
Is it algae or lichen a fungus or fern, anapaest
a true whatzit for us, anapaest
I see fanciful lace mid inherent decay, anapaest
I see whimsical bubbles entangled in play, anapaest
I see change as our mood now reverses dismay , anapaest
its an insight from moss, anapaest
In a small grassy field, anapaest
With the trees all around, anapaest
Theres a fairy ring ancient and old, anapaest
And at times you can hear, anapaest
Perfect echoes of sound , anapaest
Tis the music of ages untold, anapaest
For the crickets keep time, anapaest
To a waltz or a reel, anapaest
And the birds fill that lovely expanse, anapaest
With the notes to a tune, anapaest
In the field where the butterflies dance, anapaest
Where the wildflowers bloom, anapaest
With a sweet perfume, anapaest
In a rainbow of colours and shades, anapaest
Where the maids hurry down, anapaest
From the hilltop town, anapaest
And the butterflies dance with the maids, anapaest
On a winged pirouette, anapaest
Or a six legged slip, anapaest
And their wings flash in time, anapaest
To a bright Scottish trip, anapaest
While the lassies turn round by the burn, anapaest
For the crickets keep time, anapaest
To a waltz or a reel, anapaest
And the birds fill that lovely expanse, anapaest
With the notes to a tune, anapaest
Where the wildflowers bloom, anapaest
With a sweet perfume, anapaest
In a rainbow of colours and shades, anapaest
Where the maids hurry down, anapaest
From the hilltop town, anapaest
And the butterflies dance with the maids, anapaest
Where they splash in the stream, anapaest
Or they lie and dream, anapaest
Where the bullfrogs thrum, anapaest
While the butterflies wing, anapaest
And the hummingbirds hum, anapaest
While the merry maids sing, anapaest
Dawn chorus trills arias in duet, anapaest
Not a dulcet tone morning to forget, anapaest
Rose shot with purl, anapaest
A white wedding dress shimmers in sunlight, anapaest
Rose petals curl, anapaest
The fresh flush of a virgin prescribed writ, anapaest
The purity evident on soffit, anapaest
Rose throws to hurl, anapaest
The serene still reflection in mirror, anapaest
Belie fervid brow  tester an error, anapaest
Rose bud unfurls, anapaest
The first time I heard this I was in disbelief, anapaest
As he readied to play he rosined a long bow, anapaest
On a hill far away the notes softly and slow, anapaest
I heard voices of angels in tune through it all, anapaest
Through it all the strange notes woefully made demand, anapaest
with small pricks of conscience from the musics tearful darts, anapaest
With such lightness and patterns and passionfilled phrases, anapaest
Do you deign to reply just to prop up your selfpride, anapaest
And takes pride in the craft of his new devotee, anapaest
Magnanimity faded as rivalries grew, anapaest
With the confidence born of a spirit secure, anapaest
Many veteran artists opine to be sure, anapaest
And the metrical rhythm and pacing they find, anapaest
so essential to verse in traditional form, anapaest
With the internal metronome setting the norm, anapaest
And the imagery seen in a free verse unbound, anapaest
By the strictures and structures of metrical scheme, anapaest
Nontraditional verse deserves no less esteem, anapaest
In the end all agree that emotions the key , anapaest
And the soul of the poet must yearn to be free, anapaest
Be the uncensored voice that will sometimes annoy, anapaest
Theres a river that twists in the mind, anapaest
on crusades to the summit of rhyme, anapaest
where my Phoenix of tropes and schemes live, anapaest
In a war to free dictions fair Queen, anapaest
where the Soldiers of Babel bemuse, anapaest
and the modern day graceless regimes, anapaest
are in battles to stifle my muse, anapaest
In my quest for her verse of prestige, anapaest
I have traveled a nexus of words, anapaest
with this Lexis of language on siege, anapaest
where the dissonant hum drum is heard, anapaest
as I pin down my thoughts in a rush, anapaest
as her essence of glory I brush, anapaest
Shes the Queen Muse that whispers within, anapaest
she supplies me the yarn that I spin, anapaest
as she lends me her rhythm awhile, anapaest
Its the moment her Highness is freed, anapaest
that the Armies of Dissonance fall, anapaest
and the sound of Perfection can bleed, anapaest
in those lyrical sounds that enthrall, anapaest
I was born Bronx New York in the year 'Thirty Nine, anapaest
the first child with a brother who followed in time, anapaest
Ten years later moved North Hudson Valley same State, anapaest
where I've settled lived on with my loved ones to date, anapaest
But when young in my school two fine talents emerged, anapaest
and my teachers took time to encourage my urge, anapaest
I enjoyed my young years while I painted and penned, anapaest
lots of canvas and paper used up without end, anapaest
At nineteen I then married the love of my life, anapaest
and enjoyed my new path of becoming a wife, anapaest
to my US Marine very handsome and true, anapaest
Paris Island our home for a year almost two, anapaest
By the age twenty five I was mother of three, anapaest
a fine son two sweet girls a complete family, anapaest
We worked hard every day and our life was so good, anapaest
I wrote poems and painted whenever I could, anapaest
Later painting with oils was the pastime for me, anapaest
and I studied six years at an art gallery, anapaest
Varied art shows displays and a job filled my time, anapaest
Soon I sold many pieces and life was sublime, anapaest
Yet the years went by fast and at age thirty nine, anapaest
I enrolled in a college to study part time, anapaest
Six years later I earned my prized English degree, anapaest
a BA and a Minor in Business for me, anapaest
Then my pictures with words replaced those done thru art, anapaest
and I soon published poems of life and of heart, anapaest
Yet along in this time of my great writing spree, anapaest
I worked hard every day as our business VP, anapaest
For a full twenty years we worked hard faithfully, anapaest
after hubby retired as the Chief of FD, anapaest
selling our fire equipment all types big and small, anapaest
to FDs factories district schools and the malls, anapaest
Our dear children all married with families too, anapaest
are involved happily in whatever they do, anapaest
Happy grandma of five late twenties to eighteen, anapaest
and one granddaughter married two thousand thirteen, anapaest
We retired sold our business thirteen years ago, anapaest
still so busy with life with its ebb and its flow, anapaest
We are proud and so blessed and thank God up above, anapaest
for our days and our life of good times filled with love, anapaest
At The End Of My Rainbow, anapaest
At the end of our rainbow we're so often told, anapaest
is an awesome reserve of a pot filled with gold, anapaest
At the end of my rainbow no treasure for me, anapaest
in the form of gold coins to use up selfishly, anapaest
At the end of my rainbow inside my own pot, anapaest
will be wishes come true deep within to allot, anapaest
Like a resolute peace in each country on Earth, anapaest
no more conflicts or waroh just think of the mirth, anapaest
To see total mankind as a genus of one, anapaest
for inside we're the same from one God we do come, anapaest
Find the cure for diseasestheir mysteries solved, anapaest
so the curse of these monsters be truly dissolved, anapaest
Find a way to stop hunger both here and abroad, anapaest
with new food waste reduction plans we can applaud, anapaest
Revise government rules to be fair not corrupt, anapaest
make new laws so that violence does not erupt, anapaest
To respect our dear Earth follow her wisdom too, anapaest
with her laws keep in sync in whatever we do, anapaest
At the end of my rainbow instead of bright gold, anapaest
will be wishes come true for mankind to behold, anapaest
God's most beautiful guardian angels come down, anapaest
they descend from the heavens each one in white gown, anapaest
with their spirit they guide memy heart soul and mind, anapaest
These sweet gentle white angels embrace me, anapaest
I can see them but often are blurs undefined, anapaest
angels lead me are with me through my every day, anapaest
I can see them in beauty of life's sweet ballet, anapaest
every new day unfolds with its bright morning ray, anapaest
until nighttime delivers dark sky stars and Moon, anapaest
I can feel them nearby when I'm writing commune, anapaest
with their spirit my deep thoughts instinctively tune, anapaest
in their river of insights where artistry streams, anapaest
And wherever I am within night or daydreams, anapaest
inspiration flows from them in glorious beams, anapaest
glowing warm kindling bright for my choices to see, anapaest
God's most beautiful creatures of angels help me, anapaest
both when seen and when hidden they fly guarantee, anapaest
angel love and directionsunup till sundown, anapaest
With their spirit they guide memy heart soul and mind, anapaest
Angels lead me are with me through my every day, anapaest
until nighttime delivers dark sky stars and Moon, anapaest
In their river of insights where artistry streams, anapaest
glowing warm kindling bright for my choices to see, anapaest
angel love and directionsunup till sundown, anapaest
The first time I heard this I was in disbelief, anapaest
As he readied to play he rosined a long bow, anapaest
And he played with a flair of beauty and motif, anapaest
On a hill far away the notes softly and slow, anapaest
Without breaking his stride In the garden he played, anapaest
I heard voices of angels in tune through it all, anapaest
The heads bow their lips move the congregation prayed, anapaest
Not intending to preach someone issued the call, anapaest
Through it all the strange notes woefully made demand, anapaest
Like a Stradivari rosined strings strike their hearts, anapaest
Oh why not tonight played commanding those at hand, anapaest
with small pricks of conscience from the musics tearful darts, anapaest
At the end the blind man with the bow cross his chair, anapaest
Swore he heard the soft voice Seraphim singing slow, anapaest
Saying now find the thing that was played if you care, anapaest
should you please rearrange the anagram below, anapaest
After making the trip to Bar Harbor in Maine, anapaest
we set off on excursions within that domain, anapaest
In the midst of events aggravating arcane, anapaest
we began at a loss, anapaest
We embark on a most unpredictable task  , anapaest
touring Cadillac Mountain with fog as a mask, anapaest
Fifteen hundred feet high and sh shaking we ask, anapaest
with alarm Where's the bus, anapaest
Safely back at sea level we all need to chill  , anapaest
Tell me who put the rest stop on top of a hill, anapaest
Giving vent to our steam we release it with skill, anapaest
by creating a fuss, anapaest
So we cuss as we scurry we snort and stampede, anapaest
up the fifty two steps to attend to our need, anapaest
On the zig zag descent rather tetchy still teed, anapaest
we by chance run across, anapaest
a botanical gem   symbiotic we learn, anapaest
A bizarre kind of growth some avoid with concern, anapaest
Is it algae or lichen a fungus or fern, anapaest
a true whatzit for us, anapaest
I see fanciful lace mid inherent decay, anapaest
I see whimsical bubbles entangled in play, anapaest
I see change as our mood now reverses dismay  , anapaest
it's an insight from moss, anapaest
So I queried some poets who dance 'cross our pages, anapaest
With such lightness and patterns and passion filled phrases, anapaest
When your guidance is sought by one earnest and wide eyed, anapaest
Do you deign to reply just to prop up your self pride, anapaest
Do you tell her 'It's simple just read all you can, anapaest
About me and my writing how fluid I am', anapaest
Or perhaps you're a mentor by nature and offer, anapaest
To pry open the portals and share like an author, anapaest
Who reveals all his notes although mental they be, anapaest
And takes pride in the craft of his new devotee, anapaest
Yes 'mong even the great ones (we've heard of a few), anapaest
Magnanimity faded as rivalries grew, anapaest
So our resolute neophyte meets with the names, anapaest
Those whose art she reads daily and counsel she claims, anapaest
With the confidence born of a spirit secure, anapaest
Many veteran artists opine to be sure, anapaest
Some are eager to share of their passion for rhyme, anapaest
And the metrical rhythm and pacing they find, anapaest
so essential to verse in traditional form, anapaest
With the internal metronome setting the norm, anapaest
Yes but what about consonance diction and sound, anapaest
And the imagery seen in a free verse unbound, anapaest
By the strictures and structures of metrical scheme, anapaest
Non traditional verse deserves no less esteem, anapaest
In the end all agree that emotion's the key, anapaest
And the soul of the poet must yearn to be free, anapaest
To give access to mystery tragedy joy, anapaest
Be the uncensored voice that will sometimes annoy, anapaest
Let your passion be sovereign your unrivaled guide, anapaest
You are artist at canvass palette at your side, anapaest
Twas the night / before Christmas when all thro' the house, anapaest
Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse, anapaest
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, anapaest
In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there, anapaest
The children were nestled all snug in their beds, anapaest
While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads, anapaest
nd mamma in her 'kerchief and I in my cap, anapaest
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap, anapaest
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, anapaest
sprang from the bed to see what was the matter, anapaest
Away to the window I flew like a flash, anapaest
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash, anapaest
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow, anapaest
Gave the lustre of mid day to objects below, anapaest
When what to my wondering eyes should appear, anapaest
But a miniature sleigh and eight tinny reindeer, anapaest
With a little old driver so lively and quick, anapaest
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick, anapaest
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, anapaest
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name, anapaest
Now Dasher now Dancer now Prancer and Vixen, anapaest
On Comet On Cupid on on Donner and Blitzen, anapaest
To the top of the porch to the top of the wall, anapaest
Now dash away Dash away Dash away all, anapaest
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, anapaest
When they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky, anapaest
So up to the house top the coursers they flew, anapaest
With the sleigh full of Toys and St Nicholas too, anapaest
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof, anapaest
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof, anapaest
As I drew in my head and was turning around, anapaest
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound, anapaest
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot, anapaest
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot, anapaest
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back, anapaest
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack, anapaest
His eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry, anapaest
His cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry, anapaest
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, anapaest
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow, anapaest
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, anapaest
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath, anapaest
He had a broad face and a little round belly, anapaest
That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly, anapaest
He was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf, anapaest
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself, anapaest
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, anapaest
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread, anapaest
He spoke not a word but went straight to his work, anapaest
And filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk, anapaest
And laying his finger aside of his nose, anapaest
And giving a nod up the chimney he rose, anapaest
He sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle, anapaest
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle, anapaest
But I heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight, anapaest
Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night, anapaest
When the sparklers have sparked and the cannons have boomed, anapaest
And the flags have been flown and the flowers have bloomed, anapaest
When the coleslaw arrives and the meat has been grilled, anapaest
And the children have played and the bellies are filled, anapaest
When the families have left after long fond good byes, anapaest
And the tables are cleared we sit back with a sigh, anapaest
Then we doze and digest with a satisfied smile, anapaest
And with fondness remember the day for awhile, anapaest
But perhaps in the midst of the party and fun, anapaest
We've lost sight of the way that our freedom was won, anapaest
Let us never forget the great war that was fought, anapaest
And the price for our freedom in blood dearly bought  , anapaest
For the wisest of Men said that Truth sets you free, anapaest
And to let freedom ring Truth was nailed to a tree, anapaest
Now that I tying thy glass mask tightly, anapaest
May gaze thro' these faint smokes curling whitely, anapaest
As thou pliest thy trade in this devil's smithy , anapaest
Which is the poison to poison her prithee, anapaest
He is with her and they know that I know, anapaest
Where they are what they do they believe my tears flow, anapaest
While they laugh laugh at me at me fled to the drear, anapaest
Empty church to pray God in for them I am here, anapaest
Grind away moisten and mash up thy paste, anapaest
Pound at thy powder I am not in haste, anapaest
Better sit thus and observe thy strange things, anapaest
Than go where men wait me and dance at the King's, anapaest
That in the mortar you call it a gum, anapaest
Ah the brave tree whence such gold oozings come, anapaest
And yonder soft phial the exquisite blue, anapaest
Sure to taste sweetly is that poison too, anapaest
Had I but all of them thee and thy treasures, anapaest
What a wild crowd of invisible pleasures, anapaest
To carry pure death in an earring a casket, anapaest
A signet a fan mount a filigree basket, anapaest
Soon at the King's a mere lozenge to give, anapaest
And Pauline should have just thirty minutes to live, anapaest
But to light a pastile and Elise with her head, anapaest
And her breast and her arms and her hands should drop dead, anapaest
Quick is it finished The colour's too grim, anapaest
Why not soft like the phial's enticing and dim, anapaest
Let it brighten her drink let her turn it and stir, anapaest
And try it and taste ere she fix and prefer, anapaest
What a drop She's not little no minion like me , anapaest
That's why she ensnared him this never will free, anapaest
The soul from those masculine eyes say no, anapaest
To that pulse's magnificent come and go, anapaest
For only last night as they whispered I brought, anapaest
My own eyes to bear on her so that I thought, anapaest
Could I keep them one half minute fixed she would fall, anapaest
Shrivelled she fell not yet this does it all, anapaest
Not that I bid you spare her the pain, anapaest
Let death be felt and the proof remain, anapaest
Brand burn up bite into its grace , anapaest
He is sure to remember her dying face, anapaest
Is it done Take my mask off Nay be not morose, anapaest
It kills her and this prevents seeing it close, anapaest
The delicate droplet my whole fortune's fee , anapaest
If it hurts her beside can it ever hurt me, anapaest
Now take all my jewels gorge gold to your fill, anapaest
You may kiss me old man on my mouth if you will, anapaest
But brush this dust off me lest horror it brings, anapaest
Ere I know it next moment I dance at the King's, anapaest
LISTEN my children and you shall hear, anapaest
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, anapaest
On the eighteenth of April in Seventy five, anapaest
Hardly a man is now alive, anapaest
Who remembers that famous day and year, anapaest
He said to his friend 'If the British march, anapaest
By land or sea from the town to night, anapaest
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch, anapaest
Of the North Church tower as a signal light, anapaest
One if by land and two if by sea, anapaest
And I on the opposite shore will be, anapaest
Ready to ride and spread the alarm, anapaest
Through every Middlesex village and farm, anapaest
For the country folk to be up and to arm', anapaest
Then he said 'Good night' and with muffled oar, anapaest
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore, anapaest
Just as the moon rose over the bay, anapaest
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay, anapaest
The Somerset British man of war, anapaest
A phantom ship with each mast and spar, anapaest
Across the moon like a prison bar, anapaest
And a huge black hulk that was magnified, anapaest
By its own reflection in the tide, anapaest
Meanwhile his friend through alley and street, anapaest
Wanders and watches with eager ears, anapaest
Till in the silence around him he hears, anapaest
The muster of men at the barrack door, anapaest
The sound of arms and the tramp of feet, anapaest
And the measured tread of the grenadiers, anapaest
Marching down to their boats on the shore, anapaest
Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church, anapaest
By the wooden stairs with stealthy tread, anapaest
To the belfry chamber overhead, anapaest
And startled the pigeons from their perch, anapaest
On the sombre rafters that round him made, anapaest
Masses and moving shapes of shade, anapaest
By the trembling ladder steep and tall, anapaest
To the highest window in the wall, anapaest
Where he paused to listen and look down, anapaest
A moment on the roofs of the town, anapaest
And the moonlight flowing over all, anapaest
Beneath in the churchyard lay the dead, anapaest
In their night encampment on the hill, anapaest
Wrapped in silence so deep and still, anapaest
That he could hear like a sentinel's tread, anapaest
The watchful night wind as it went, anapaest
Creeping along from tent to tent, anapaest
And seeming to whisper 'All is well', anapaest
A moment only he feels the spell, anapaest
Of the place and the hour and the secret dread, anapaest
Of the lonely belfry and the dead, anapaest
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent, anapaest
On a shadowy something far away, anapaest
Where the river widens to meet the bay, anapaest
A line of black that bends and floats, anapaest
On the rising tide like a bridge of boats, anapaest
Meanwhile impatient to mount and ride, anapaest
Booted and spurred with a heavy stride, anapaest
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere, anapaest
Now he patted his horse's side, anapaest
Now gazed at the landscape far and near, anapaest
Then impetuous stamped the earth, anapaest
And turned and tightened his saddle girth, anapaest
But mostly he watched with eager search, anapaest
The belfry tower of the Old North Church, anapaest
As it rose above the graves on the hill, anapaest
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still, anapaest
And lo as he looks on the belfry's height, anapaest
A glimmer and then a gleam of light, anapaest
He springs to the saddle the bridle he turns, anapaest
But lingers and gazes till full on his sight, anapaest
A second lamp in the belfry burns, anapaest
A hurry of hoofs in a village street, anapaest
A shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark, anapaest
And beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark, anapaest
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet, anapaest
That was all And yet through the gloom and the light, anapaest
The fate of a nation was riding that night, anapaest
And the spark struck out by that steed in his flight, anapaest
Kindled the land into flame with its heat, anapaest
He has left the village and mounted the steep, anapaest
And beneath him tranquil and broad and deep, anapaest
Is the Mystic meeting the ocean tides, anapaest
And under the alders that skirt its edge, anapaest
Now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge, anapaest
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides, anapaest
LISTEN my children and you shall hear, anapaest
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere, anapaest
On the eighteenth of April in Seventy five, anapaest
Hardly a man is now alive, anapaest
Who remembers that famous day and year, anapaest

Is the Mystic meeting the ocean tides, anapaest
And under the alders that skirt its edge, anapaest
Now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge, anapaest
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides, anapaest
It was twelve by the village clock, anapaest
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town, anapaest
He heard the crowing of the cock, anapaest
And the barking of the farmer's dog, anapaest
And felt the damp of the river fog, anapaest
That rises after the sun goes down, anapaest
It was one by the village clock, anapaest
When he galloped into Lexington, anapaest
He saw the gilded weathercock, anapaest
Swim in the moonlight as he passed, anapaest
And the meeting house windows blank and bare, anapaest
Gaze at him with a spectral glare, anapaest
As if they already stood aghast, anapaest
At the bloody work they would look upon, anapaest
It was two by the village clock, anapaest
When he came to the bridge in Concord town, anapaest
He heard the bleating of the flock, anapaest
And the twitter of birds among the trees, anapaest
And felt the breath of the morning breeze, anapaest
Blowing over the meadows brown, anapaest
And one was safe and asleep in his bed, anapaest
Who at the bridge would be first to fall, anapaest
Who that day would be lying dead, anapaest
Pierced by a British musket ball, anapaest
You know the rest In the books you have read, anapaest
How the British Regulars fired and fled, anapaest
How the farmers gave them ball for ball, anapaest
From behind each fence and farm yard wall, anapaest
Chasing the red coats down the lane, anapaest
Then crossing the fields to emerge again, anapaest
Under the trees at the turn of the road, anapaest
And only pausing to fire and load, anapaest
So through the night rode Paul Revere, anapaest
And so through the night went his cry of alarm, anapaest
To every Middlesex village and farm, anapaest
A cry of defiance and not of fear, anapaest
A voice in the darkness a knock at the door, anapaest
And a word that shall echo forevermore, anapaest
For borne on the night wind of the Past, anapaest
Through all our history to the last, anapaest
In the hour of darkness and peril and need, anapaest
The people will waken and listen to hear, anapaest
The hurrying hoof beats of that steed, anapaest
And the midnight message of Paul Revere, anapaest
Does it matter losing your legs, anapaest
For people will always be kind, anapaest
And you need not show that you mind, anapaest
To gobble their muffins and eggs, anapaest
Does it matter losing your sight, anapaest
There's such splendid work for the blind, anapaest
And people will always be kind, anapaest
As you sit on the terrace remembering, anapaest
And turning your face to the light, anapaest
Do they matter those dreams from the pit, anapaest
You can drink and forget and be glad, anapaest
And people won't say that you're mad, anapaest
For they'll know you've fought for your country, anapaest
And no one will worry a bit, anapaest
O rose thou art sick, anapaest
The invisible worm, anapaest
That flies in the night, anapaest
In the howling storm, anapaest
Has found out thy bed, anapaest
Of crimson joy, anapaest
And his dark secret love, anapaest
Does thy life destroy, anapaest
The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold, anapaest
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold, anapaest
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea, anapaest
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee, anapaest
Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green, anapaest
That host with their banners at sunset were seen, anapaest
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown, anapaest
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown, anapaest
For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast, anapaest
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed, anapaest
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill, anapaest
And their hearts but once heaved and for ever grew still, anapaest
And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide, anapaest
But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride, anapaest
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf, anapaest
And cold as the spray of the rock beating surf, anapaest
And there lay the rider distorted and pale, anapaest
With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail, anapaest
And the tents were all silent the banners alone, anapaest
The lances unlifted the trumpet unblown, anapaest
Autumn is wearing her bright golden crown, anapaest
For this morning shes coming to visit our town, anapaest
And Wind her best friend will be joining her too, anapaest
Will they have a nice day and just what will they do, anapaest
Shell be changing the colours of leaves on our trees, anapaest
And Wind likes to tease with his cold playful breeze, anapaest
As the leaves tumble down in a pile on the ground, anapaest
He will take a deep breath and blow them around, anapaest
They'll both knock down conkers for children to find, anapaest
But the nuts arent just there for the good of mankind, anapaest
The squirrels like nuts and theyll store them away, anapaest
But then out they will come on those cold wintry days, anapaest
So what do you think that the two friends might eat, anapaest
What sorts of things would be good for a treat, anapaest
There are sweet tasting berries and fruits of all kinds, anapaest
Which are wonderful treats for the two friends to find, anapaest
They will chase over hills and along by the river, anapaest
Winds cold wintry breath may well cause us to shiver, anapaest
The swallows will see them and say their goodbye, anapaest
Calling See you next year as they fly through the sky, anapaest
With the sun going down theres no time left to play, anapaest
But the two friends have had such a marvellous day, anapaest
When you look all around at this colourful scene, anapaest
You will see very clearly where these friends have been, anapaest
The tiger stretches limb by limb, anapaest
He views his world through sleepy eyes, anapaest
And wonders what his day will bring, anapaest
He does these things and so do I, anapaest
The bear sets forth to hunt for food, anapaest
And rambles under cloudy skies, anapaest
He ponders what hell eat today, anapaest
He looks for food and so do I, anapaest
All creatures teach their young to hunt, anapaest
And watch for danger lest they die, anapaest
The parents teach the skills of life, anapaest
Their young learn these and so do I, anapaest
The creatures of the day will seek, anapaest
A place to sleep thats warm and dry, anapaest
A safe abode thats far from harm, anapaest
They drift to sleep and so do I, anapaest
The bull in the meadow was bellowing hard, anapaest
With a bawling and blustering blare, anapaest
But the cows thought the bull was just showing off, anapaest
And continued to graze without care, anapaest
His shouting his screaming his clamorous cry, anapaest
Continued by day and by night, anapaest
His vociferous roaring soon got on their nerves, anapaest
Whilst the mice and the birds fled in fright, anapaest
The farmer then noticed the terrible noise, anapaest
And he called in the vet to the scene, anapaest
The vet scratched his head and only could say, anapaest
Its the noisiest bull that Ive seen, anapaest
I remember he lived at the farm up the road, anapaest
And he had a particular friend, anapaest
I suggest that you buy her to go with your herd, anapaest
And Im sure that his roaring will end, anapaest
So next week a new cow arrived in their field, anapaest
Shed been bought from the neighbouring farm, anapaest
Shed endearing brown eyes and a beautiful face, anapaest
Was friendly and so full of charm, anapaest
Oh Maisie my girlfriend the noisy bull said, anapaest
How Ive missed you since we said goodbye, anapaest
It was obvious that Maisie was pleased to see him, anapaest
And mooed with delight in reply, anapaest
Now peace reigns supremely the pastures are quiet, anapaest
Theres birdsong and flowers in the spring  , anapaest
And everyones happy especially the bull, anapaest
Yes loves truly a wonderful thing, anapaest
There was a field in Nazareth beside a joiner's yard, anapaest
A little donkey stood and sighed   his life had been so hard, anapaest
Im getting old and not much use for carrying heavy loads  , anapaest
For trudging round the town all day on hot and dusty roads, anapaest
His kindly master Joseph said You mustnt worry now, anapaest
Just spend your old age quietly wth Bess our milking cow, anapaest
So Bess and he stayed in the field and watched the world go by, anapaest
When suddenly from Heaven appeared an angel in the sky, anapaest
Theres one last job on earth for you  a journey to be done, anapaest
A special donkeys what we need for Mary and her son, anapaest
From Nazareth to Bethlehem that is the road to take, anapaest
Weve chosen you to do this task especially for Gods sake, anapaest
But I am old and useless the little donkey cried  , anapaest
But there again Id like the job for I feel quite young inside, anapaest
The day arrived and off they set in sunshine warm and bright, anapaest
They travelled over dusty roads arriving before night, anapaest
There were such a lot of people   Bethlehem was really packed  , anapaest
And many other donkeys came with loads upon their backs, anapaest
The only place they all could rest was in a stable warm, anapaest
The little donkey stood nearby when Jesus Christ was born, anapaest
He went to sleep so happy Im not useless after all, anapaest
He dreamed about an angel who came to his stable stall, anapaest
Your work on earth is finished Come to Heaven and take your rest, anapaest
God will love to have you with Him Of all donkeys youre the best, anapaest
Im the King of the Deep and rule all I survey, anapaest
Will you please swim aside and keep out of my way, anapaest
I'm the proudest of creatures with speed of a bird, anapaest
And from hundreds of miles my voice can be heard, anapaest
Im Lord of the Ocean blue whale of the sea, anapaest
Observe me admire me resplendent and free, anapaest
Watch me diving and rising then diving again, anapaest
I'm a breathtaking giant in my global domain, anapaest
My heart is colossal Im streamlined and sleek, anapaest
And Im proud to display both my strength and physique, anapaest
Blue whale calves will gain weight at ten pounds a day, anapaest
And for more than a year with their parents they'll stay, anapaest
I rule the oceans for Im King of the Deep, anapaest
I take naps on my journey but don't need to sleep, anapaest
Whilst your kings wear their crowns and magnificent robes, anapaest
In my mantle of blubber I circle the globe, anapaest
I'm lean and I'm mean and I forage alone, anapaest
I'm shaggy I'm scraggy and to others well known, anapaest
Im canny I'm cunning and have both wile and wit, anapaest
They say I have strong jaws Its true I'll admit, anapaest
I'm rough and I'm tough and I prowl the wide plain, anapaest
Im both scavenger and nomad with long unkempt mane, anapaest
I'm tawny I'm brawny and in the rays of this moon, anapaest
With good fortune my ally I may feed very soon, anapaest
