337,while she pitied my passion and seem'd to approve,anapaestic,10
338,ah me with what raptur'd attention i've hung,anapaestic,10
339,to catch the sweet accents that flow'd from her tongue,anapaestic,10
340,when tenderness bade the dear maiden impart,anapaestic,10
341,the pleasing sensations that glow'd in her heart,anapaestic,10
342,o how does my fair one consume the long day,anapaestic,10

346,ah did she but think with such fondness as i,anapaestic,10
347,how much would she grieve and how oft would she sigh,anapaestic,10
348,yet with so much fond love may her bosom ne'er burn,anapaestic,10

418,it blew an hard storm and in utmost confusion,anapaestic,10
419,the sailors all hurried to get absolution,anapaestic,10
420,which done and the weight of the sins they'd confess'd,anapaestic,10
421,was transfer'd as they thought from themselves to the priest,anapaestic,10
422,to lighten the ship and conclude their devotion,anapaestic,10
423,they toss'd the poor parson souse into the ocean,anapaestic,10
1877,as near portobello lying,trochaic,8
1878,on the gently swelling flood,trochaic,8
1879,at midnight with streamers flying,trochaic,8
1880,our triumphant navy rode,trochaic,8
1881,there while vernon sate allglorious,trochaic,8
1882,from the spaniards' late defeat,trochaic,8
1883,and his crews with shouts victorious,trochaic,8
1884,drank success to england's fleet,trochaic,8
1885,on a sudden shrilly sounding,trochaic,8
1886,hideous yells and skrieks were heard,trochaic,8
1887,then each heart with fear confounding,trochaic,8
1888,a sad troop of ghosts appear'd,trochaic,8
1889,all in dreary hammocks shrouded,trochaic,8
1890,which for windingsheets they wore,trochaic,8
1891,and with looks by sorrow clouded,trochaic,8
1892,frowning on that hostile shore,trochaic,8
1893,on them gleam'd the moon's wan lustre,trochaic,8
1894,when the shade of hosier brave,trochaic,8
1895,his pale bands was seen to muster,trochaic,8
1896,rising from their watry grave,trochaic,8
1897,o'er the glimmering wave he hy'd him,trochaic,8
1898,where the burford rear'd her sail,trochaic,8
1899,with three thousand ghosts besides him,trochaic,8
1900,and in groans did vernon hail,trochaic,8
1901,heed oh heed our fatal story,trochaic,8
1902,i am hosier's injur'd ghost,trochaic,8
1903,you who now have purchas'd glory,trochaic,8
1904,at this place where i was lost,trochaic,8
1905,tho' in portobello's ruin,trochaic,8
1906,you now triumph free from fears,trochaic,8
1907,when you think on our undoing,trochaic,8
1908,you will mix your joy with tears,trochaic,8
1909,see these mournful spectres sweeping,trochaic,8
1910,ghastly o'er this hated wave,trochaic,8
1911,whose wan cheeks are stain'd with weeping,trochaic,8
1912,these were english captains brave,trochaic,8
1913,mark those numbers pale and horrid,trochaic,8
1914,those were once my failors bold,trochaic,8
1915,lo each hangs his drooping forehead,trochaic,8
1916,while his dismal tale is told,trochaic,8
1917,i by twenty sail attended,trochaic,8
1918,did this spanish town affright,trochaic,8
1919,nothing then its wealth defended,trochaic,8
1920,but my orders not to fight,trochaic,8
1921,oh that in this rolling ocean,trochaic,8
1922,i had cast them with disdain,trochaic,8
1923,and obey'd my heart's warm motion,trochaic,8
1924,to have quell'd the pride of spain,trochaic,8
1925,for resistance i could fear none,trochaic,8
1926,but with twenty ships had done,trochaic,8
1927,what thou brave and happy vernon,trochaic,8
1928,hast atchiev'd with six alone,trochaic,8
1929,then the bastimentos never,trochaic,8
1930,had our foul dishonour seen,trochaic,8
1931,nor the sea the sad receiver,trochaic,8
1932,of this gallant train had been,trochaic,8
1933,thus like thee proud spain dismaying,trochaic,8
1934,and her galleons leading home,trochaic,8
1935,though condemn'd for disobeying,trochaic,8
1936,i had met a traitor's doom,trochaic,8
1937,to have fallen my country crying,trochaic,8
1938,he has play'd an english part,trochaic,8
1939,had been better far than dying,trochaic,8
1940,of a griev'd and broken heart,trochaic,8
1941,unrepining at thy glory,trochaic,8
1942,thy successful arms we hail,trochaic,8
1943,but remember our sad story,trochaic,8
1944,and let hosier's wrongs prevail,trochaic,8
1945,sent in this foul clime to languish,trochaic,8
1946,think what thousands fell in vain,trochaic,8
1947,wasted with disease and anguish,trochaic,8
1948,not in glorious battle slain,trochaic,8
1949,hence with all my train attending,trochaic,8
1950,from their oozy tombs below,trochaic,8
1951,thro' the hoary foam ascending,trochaic,8
1952,here i feed my constant woe,trochaic,8
1953,here the bastimentos viewing,trochaic,8
1954,we recal our shameful doom,trochaic,8
1955,and our plaintive cries renewing,trochaic,8
1956,wander thro' the midnight gloom,trochaic,8
1957,o'er these waves for ever mourning,trochaic,8
1958,shall we roam depriv'd of rest,trochaic,8
1959,if to britain's shores returning,trochaic,8
1960,you neglect my just request,trochaic,8
1961,after this proud foe subduing,trochaic,8
1962,when your patriot friends you see,trochaic,8
1963,think on vengeance for my ruin,trochaic,8
1964,and for england sham'd in me,trochaic,8
1965,then sleep for an hour or two and no more,anapaestic,10
1966,at nine stretch your arms and oh think when alone,anapaestic,10

1974,at twelve you may walk for at this time o' the year,anapaestic,10
1975,the sun like your wit is as mild as 'tis clear,anapaestic,10

1977,take the hint and let life be improv'd in its prime,anapaestic,10
1978,return not in haste nor of dressing take heed,anapaestic,10
1979,for beauty like yours no assistance can need,anapaestic,10
1980,with an appetite thus down to dinner you sit,anapaestic,10
1981,where the chief of the feast is the flow of your wit,anapaestic,10

1987,and calm with your joys gently glide thro' the day,anapaestic,10
1988,the dews of the evening most carefully shun,anapaestic,10
1989,those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun,anapaestic,10
1990,then in chat or at play with a dance or a song,anapaestic,10
1991,let the night like the day pass with pleasure along,anapaestic,10
1992,all cares but of love banish far from your mind,anapaestic,10

3080,he neglected his dress and his hair,anapaestic,10
3081,and by solitude fed his disease,anapaestic,10
3082,poor shepherd he wildly exclaim'd,anapaestic,10
3083,alas what avails all thy moan,anapaestic,10
3084,the joys thy fond fancy had fram'd,anapaestic,10
3085,with daphne for ever are flown,anapaestic,10
3086,how could you o daphne deceive,anapaestic,10
3087,a swain not unworthy your love,anapaestic,10
3088,why didst thou alexis believe,anapaestic,10
3089,such a maid could thy passion approve,anapaestic,10
3090,her form is replete with each grace,anapaestic,10
3091,the diamond beams forth in her eye,anapaestic,10
3092,the lily expands o'er her face,anapaestic,10
3093,and the rosebud imparts its soft dye,anapaestic,10
3094,no warbler can rival her song,anapaestic,10
3095,philomela with envy complains,anapaestic,10
3096,the streams glide in silence along,anapaestic,10
3097,the glad zephyrs diffuse her soft strains,anapaestic,10
3098,when daphne appear'd in the mead,anapaestic,10
3099,her presence enliven'd the morn,anapaestic,10
3100,now the winds roughly blow round my head,anapaestic,10
3101,and the sun's chearful beams are withdrawn,anapaestic,10
3102,no longer these meadows look green,anapaestic,10
3103,now the warblers abandon the grove,anapaestic,10
3104,the air breathes no longer serene,anapaestic,10
3105,all summer is fled with my love,anapaestic,10
3106,oh daphne you heard my fond sighs,anapaestic,10
3107,you did not my passion disdain,anapaestic,10
3108,when i gaz'd with delight on your eyes,anapaestic,10
3109,my soft glances you did not restrain,anapaestic,10
3110,but now you make sport of my woes,anapaestic,10
3111,and laugh at the sufferings i feel,anapaestic,10
3112,i enjoy not the sweets of repose,anapaestic,10
3113,nor can i my torments conceal,anapaestic,10
3114,farewell ye sad scenes of my love,anapaestic,10
3115,i shall never revisit you more,anapaestic,10
3116,adieu to the mead an he grove,anapaestic,10
3117,'twas here i first learn'd to adore,anapaestic,10
3118,i will banish this wretch from her sight,anapaestic,10
3119,i know not what fate may ensue,anapaestic,10
3120,never more can i taste of delight,anapaestic,10
3121,to every enjoyment adieu,anapaestic,10
3122,with a torrent of heartbursting grief,anapaestic,10
3123,alexis continues his moan,anapaestic,10
3124,tears gave him some little relief,anapaestic,10
3125,yet he ceas'd not to sigh and to groan,anapaestic,10
3126,pastora by chance hasten'd by,anapaestic,10
3127,she saw the poor shepherd's despair,anapaestic,10
3128,soft pity appear'd in her eye,anapaestic,10
3129,she ask'd him the source of his care,anapaestic,10
3130,what cause has alexis to weep,anapaestic,10
3131,with looks of compassion she said,anapaestic,10
3132,have you lost e'er a lamb or a sheep,anapaestic,10
3133,or is tray the poor favourite dead,anapaestic,10
3134,or perhaps your fair daphne's unkind,anapaestic,10
3135,perhaps for her coyness you grieve,anapaestic,10
3136,ah 'tis jealousy poisons your mind,anapaestic,10
3137,but appearances often deceive,anapaestic,10
3138,the shepherd just rais'd up his head,anapaestic,10
3139,he thank'd the kind maid for her care,anapaestic,10
3140,he confess'd that all comfort was fled,anapaestic,10
3141,and nothing was left but despair,anapaestic,10
3142,pastora e'en wept at the tale,anapaestic,10
3143,and wish'd she could ease his distress,anapaestic,10
3144,could her interest with daphne prevail,anapaestic,10
3145,his suffering should soon find redress,anapaestic,10
3146,he gaz'd on the fair with surprize,anapaestic,10
3147,and admir'd the goodnature she shew'd,anapaestic,10
3148,when she went he withdrew not his eyes,anapaestic,10
3149,but with pleasure her footsteps pursu'd,anapaestic,10
3150,her sweetness her beauty and truth,anapaestic,10
3151,with daphne's late falshood compar'd,anapaestic,10
3152,so charm'd so astonish'd the youth,anapaestic,10
3153,that his heart for a change was prepar'd,anapaestic,10
3154,yet still his fond wish would arise,anapaestic,10
3155,ah was but my daphne thus kind,anapaestic,10
3156,i would wipe off these tears from my eyes,anapaestic,10
3157,and give up my sighs to the wind,anapaestic,10
3158,he said and arose from the ground,anapaestic,10
3159,then instant return'd to his cot,anapaestic,10
3160,soon in sleep every suffering was drown'd,anapaestic,10
3161,and daphne's unkindness forgot,anapaestic,10
3162,with the sun the next morn he arose,anapaestic,10
3163,pastora he sought in the grove,anapaestic,10
3164,he repeated the tale of his woes,anapaestic,10
3165,and mourn'd the sad fate of his love,anapaestic,10
3166,pastora heard every complaint,anapaestic,10
3167,again he imparted his grief,anapaestic,10
3168,he talk'd without fear or constraint,anapaestic,10
3169,and found from her converse relief,anapaestic,10
3170,the friendship he felt for the fair,anapaestic,10
3171,each meeting still serv'd to improve,anapaestic,10
3172,he then blest his late cause of despair,anapaestic,10
3173,and became a true votary to love,anapaestic,10
3174,'twas no longer for beauty he sigh'd,anapaestic,10
3175,he no longer to merit was blind,anapaestic,10
3176,'twas his joy and a laudable pride,anapaestic,10
3177,that he valu'd the charms of the mind,anapaestic,10
3178,pastora with blushes confest,anapaestic,10
3179,that she felt all the force of true love,anapaestic,10
3180,but that reason her passion supprest,anapaestic,10
3181,yet that now she must own and approve,anapaestic,10
3182,she soon gave her hand to the swain,anapaestic,10
3183,who proclaim'd to each shepherd this truth,anapaestic,10
3184,he had met a reward for his pain,anapaestic,10
3185,more lasting than beauty and youth,anapaestic,10
3186,when spring decks with verdure the mead,anapaestic,10
3187,love wafts milder fragrance around,anapaestic,10
3188,when summer invites to the shade,anapaestic,10
3189,love strews with fresh flowrets the ground,anapaestic,10
3190,in autumn thro' cornfields they rove,anapaestic,10
3191,and their loves as in springtime appear,anapaestic,10
3192,tho' winter disrobes the known grove,anapaestic,10
3193,yet their love varies not with the year,anapaestic,10
3194,ye nymphs to this maxim attend,anapaestic,10
3195,tho' beauty awhile may allure,anapaestic,10
3196,yet to fix in the lover the friend,anapaestic,10
3197,'tis virtue alone is secure,anapaestic,10
3198,ye swains who are caught by a face,anapaestic,10
3199,know that beauty will quickly decay,anapaestic,10
3200,that virtue still heightens each grace,anapaestic,10
3201,and imparts more than time steals away,anapaestic,10
3503,on the banks of that crystalline stream,anapaestic,10
3504,where thames oft his current delays,anapaestic,10
3505,and charms more than poets can dream,anapaestic,10
3506,in his richmond's bright villa surveys,anapaestic,10
3507,fair ella of all the gay throng,anapaestic,10
3508,the fairest that nature had seen,anapaestic,10
3509,now drew every village along,anapaestic,10
3510,from the day she first danc'd on the green,anapaestic,10
3511,ah boast not of beauty's fond power,anapaestic,10
3512,for short is the triumph ye fair,anapaestic,10
3513,not fleeter the bloom of each flower,anapaestic,10
3514,and hope is but gilded despair,anapaestic,10
3515,his affection each swain now behold,anapaestic,10
3516,by riches endeavours to prove,anapaestic,10
3517,but ella still cries what is gold,anapaestic,10
3518,or wealth when compar'd to his love,anapaestic,10
3519,yes allen together we'll wield,anapaestic,10
3520,our sickles in summer's bright day,anapaestic,10
3521,together we'll lease o'er the field,anapaestic,10
3522,and smile all our labours away,anapaestic,10
3523,in winter i'll winnow the wheat,anapaestic,10
3524,as it falls from thy flail on the ground,anapaestic,10
3525,that flail will be music as sweet,anapaestic,10
3526,when thy voice in the labour is drown'd,anapaestic,10
3527,how oft would he speak of his bliss,anapaestic,10
3528,how oft would he call her his maid,anapaestic,10
3529,and allen would seal with a kiss,anapaestic,10
3530,every promise and vow that he said,anapaestic,10
3531,but hark o'er the grasslevelc land,anapaestic,10
3532,the village bells sound on the plain,anapaestic,10
3533,false allen this morn gave his hand,anapaestic,10
3534,and ella's sond tears are in vain,anapaestic,10
3535,sad ella too soon heard the tale,anapaestic,10
3536,too soon the sad cause she was told,anapaestic,10
3537,that his was a nymph of the vale,anapaestic,10
3538,that he broke his sond promise for gold,anapaestic,10
3539,as she walk'd by the margin so green,anapaestic,10
3540,which befringes the sweet river's side,anapaestic,10
3541,how oft' was she languishing seen,anapaestic,10
3542,how oft' would she gaze on the tide,anapaestic,10
3543,by the clear river then as she sate,anapaestic,10
3544,which reflected herself and the mead,anapaestic,10
3545,awhile she bewept her sad fate,anapaestic,10
3546,and the green turf still pillow'd her head,anapaestic,10
3547,there there is it ella i see,anapaestic,10
3548,'tis ella the lost undone maid,anapaestic,10
3549,ah no 'tis some ella like me,anapaestic,10
3550,some hapless young virgin betray'd,anapaestic,10
3551,like me she has sorrow'd and wept,anapaestic,10
3552,like me she has fondly believ'd,anapaestic,10
3553,like me her true promise she kept,anapaestic,10
3554,and like me too is justly deceiv'd,anapaestic,10
3555,i come dear companion in grief,anapaestic,10
3556,gay scenes and fond pleasures adieu,anapaestic,10
3557,i come and we'll gather relief,anapaestic,10
3558,from bosoms so chaste and so true,anapaestic,10
3559,like you i have mourn'd the long night,anapaestic,10
3560,and wept out the day in despair,anapaestic,10
3561,like you i have banish'd delight,anapaestic,10
3562,and bosom'd a friend in my care,anapaestic,10
3563,ye meadows so lovely farewel,anapaestic,10
3564,your velvet still allen shall tread,anapaestic,10
3565,all deaf to the sound of that knell,anapaestic,10
3566,which tolls for his ella when dead,anapaestic,10
3567,your wish will too sure be obey'd,anapaestic,10
3568,nor allen her loss shall bemoan,anapaestic,10
3569,soon soon shall poor ella be laid,anapaestic,10
3570,where her heart shall be cold as your own,anapaestic,10
3571,then twin'd in the arms of that fair,anapaestic,10
3572,whose wealth has been ella's sad fate,anapaestic,10
3573,as together ye draw the free air,anapaestic,10
3574,and a thousand dear pleasures relate,anapaestic,10
3575,if chance o'er my turf as ye tread,anapaestic,10
3576,ye dare to affect a fond sigh,anapaestic,10
3577,the primrose will shrink her pale head,anapaestic,10
3578,and the violet languish and die,anapaestic,10
3579,ah weep not fond maid 'tis in vain,anapaestic,10
3580,like the tears which you lend to the stream,anapaestic,10
3581,tears are lost in that watery plain,anapaestic,10
3582,and your sighs are still lost upon him,anapaestic,10
3583,scarce echo had gather'd the sound,anapaestic,10
3584,but she plung'd from her grassspringing bed,anapaestic,10
3585,the liquid stream parts to the ground,anapaestic,10
3586,and the mirror clos'd over her head,anapaestic,10
3587,the swains of the village at eve,anapaestic,10
3588,oft meet at the darkspreading yew,anapaestic,10
3589,there wonder how man could deceive,anapaestic,10
3590,a bosom so chaste and so true,anapaestic,10
3591,with garlands of every flower,anapaestic,10
3592,which ella herself should have made,anapaestic,10
3593,they raise up a shortliving bower,anapaestic,10
3594,and sighing cry peace to her shade,anapaestic,10
3595,then handlock'dinhand as they move,anapaestic,10
3596,the greenplatting hillock around,anapaestic,10
3597,they talk of poor ella and love,anapaestic,10
3598,and freshen with tears the fair ground,anapaestic,10
3599,nay wish they had never been born,anapaestic,10
3600,or liv'd the sad moment to view,anapaestic,10
3601,when her allen could thus be forsworn,anapaestic,10
3602,and his ella could still be so true,anapaestic,10
4004,in the dead of the night when with labour oppress'd,anapaestic,10
4005,all mortals enjoy the calm blessing of rest,anapaestic,10
4006,cupid knock'd at my door i awoke with the noise,anapaestic,10
4007,and who is it i call'd that my sleep thus destroys,anapaestic,10
4008,you need not be frighten'd he answered mild,anapaestic,10
4009,let me in i'm a little unfortunate child,anapaestic,10
4010,'tis a dark rainy night and i'm wet to the skin,anapaestic,10
4011,and my way i have lost and do pray let me in,anapaestic,10
4012,i was mov'd with compassion and striking a light,anapaestic,10
4013,i open'd the door when a boy stood in sight,anapaestic,10
4014,who had wings on his shoulders the rain from him dripp'd,anapaestic,10
4015,with a bow and with arrows too he was equipp'd,anapaestic,10
4016,i stirr'd up my fire and close by its side,anapaestic,10
4017,i set him down by me with napkins i dried,anapaestic,10
4018,i chaf'd him all over kept out the cold air,anapaestic,10
4019,and i wrung with my hands the wet out of his hair,anapaestic,10
4020,he from wet and from cold was no sooner at ease,anapaestic,10
4021,but taking his bow up he said if you please,anapaestic,10
4022,we will try it i would by experiment know,anapaestic,10
4023,if the wet hath not damag'd the string of my bow,anapaestic,10
4024,forthwith from his quiver an arrow he drew,anapaestic,10
4025,to the string he apply'd it and twang went the yew,anapaestic,10
4026,the arrow was gone in my bosom it center'd,anapaestic,10
4027,no sting of a hornet more sharp ever enter'd,anapaestic,10
4028,away skipp'd the urchin as brisk as a bee,anapaestic,10
4029,and laughing i wish you much joy friend quoth he,anapaestic,10
4030,my bow is undamag'd for true went the dart,anapaestic,10
4031,but you will have trouble enough with your heart,anapaestic,10
4132,sue venal belinda to grant you the blessing,anapaestic,10
4133,as jove courted danae or vain's your addressing,anapaestic,10
4134,for love she asserts all that's generous inspires,anapaestic,10
4135,and therefore rich tokens of love she requires,anapaestic,10
4136,such suitors as nothing but ardours are boasting,anapaestic,10
4137,will ne'er reach elysium but ever be coasting,anapaestic,10
4138,like pennyless ghosts deny'd passage by charon,anapaestic,10
4139,they'll find without fee unrelenting the fair one,anapaestic,10
4140,but give me the nymph not ungrateful to wooing,anapaestic,10
4141,who love pays with love and caresses with cooing,anapaestic,10
4142,by whom a true heart is accepted as sterling,anapaestic,10
4143,and cupid alone makes her lover her darling,anapaestic,10
4151,ye myrtles and woodbines so green,anapaestic,10
4152,ye bow'rs that with rapture i've seen,anapaestic,10
4153,when his heart beat with every look,anapaestic,10
4154,when he left both his pipe and his crook,anapaestic,10
4155,each hour he employ'd for his dear,anapaestic,10
4156,the sweet bryar and violet did rear,anapaestic,10
4157,with roses and hiacynths fair,anapaestic,10
4158,sweet chaplets he wove for her hair,anapaestic,10
4159,at noon's scorching heat we retir'd,anapaestic,10
4160,or else to the wood he admir'd,anapaestic,10
4161,with his song did the shepherd delight,anapaestic,10
4162,my steps did the charmer invite,anapaestic,10
4163,but ah to my sorrow i find,anapaestic,10
4164,that damon is false as the wind,anapaestic,10
4165,with scorn doth he slight all my charms,anapaestic,10
4166,with hatred he flies from my arms,anapaestic,10
4167,the garland he wove for my hair,anapaestic,10
4168,the crook that he bought at the fair,anapaestic,10
4169,the bow'r which for delia he made,anapaestic,10
4170,of the grot and the silver cascade,anapaestic,10
4171,my flocks can no longer delight,anapaestic,10
4172,for when damon is out of my sight,anapaestic,10
4173,no more do i sport on the plain,anapaestic,10
4174,'till damon doth pity my pain,anapaestic,10
4477,when phoebus was am'rous and long'd to be rude,anapaestic,10
4478,miss daphne cry'd pish and ran swift to the wood,anapaestic,10
4479,and rather than do such a naughty affair,anapaestic,10
4480,she became a fine laurel to deck the god's hair,anapaestic,10
4481,the nymph was no doubt of a cold constitution,anapaestic,10
4482,for sure to turn tree was an odd resolution,anapaestic,10
4483,yet in this she behav'd like a true modern spouse,anapaestic,10
4484,for she fled from his arms to distinguish his brows,anapaestic,10
4641,my lord of killala i find to my sorrow,anapaestic,10
4642,i can't have the honour i hop'd for tomorrow,anapaestic,10
4643,but why i'm so wretched my friend must rehearse,anapaestic,10
4644,for i never can write my vexations in verse,anapaestic,10
4645,disappointments are sent to poor mortals to show,anapaestic,10
4646,'tis in vain to expect to be happy below,anapaestic,10
4647,yet you've a fair prospect it must be confess'd,anapaestic,10
4648,who with fortune and station and delia are bless'd,anapaestic,10
4649,with delia whose soul is so fitted for you,anapaestic,10
4650,who shares with such pleasure the good which you do,anapaestic,10
4651,who visits your see with far other designs,anapaestic,10
4652,than conning your rentrolls and raising your fines,anapaestic,10
4653,no longer let rome her old argument boast,anapaestic,10
4654,that by marriage the end of the priesthood is lost,anapaestic,10
4655,that toil'd and entangled in family cares,anapaestic,10
4656,the clergy forget their celestial affairs,anapaestic,10
4657,for had she known delia she must have confess'd,anapaestic,10
4658,that the church in the marriage of prelates was bless'd,anapaestic,10
7020,and auld robin forbes hes gien tem a dance,anapaestic,10
7021,i pat on my speckets to see them aw prance,anapaestic,10

7049,that age time or death can divide thee and me,anapaestic,10
7050,for that spot on earth that's aye dearest to me,anapaestic,10
7051,is the turf that has cover'd my willy frae me,anapaestic,10
7052,by the lyre of apollo the locks of the muses,anapaestic,10
7053,and the pure lucid stream aganippe produces,anapaestic,10
7054,my ellis i love thee then pay me in kind,anapaestic,10
7055,let the thought of a friend never slip from your mind,anapaestic,10
7056,so may fancy and judgment together combine,anapaestic,10
7057,and the bosom be fill'd with an ardor divine,anapaestic,10
7058,that thy brows may the laurel with justice still claim,anapaestic,10
7059,and the temple of liberty mount thee to fame,anapaestic,10
7060,if it e'er can give pleasure to know my career,anapaestic,10
7061,when proud london i left with intentions so queer,anapaestic,10
7062,accept it in verse on the very first day,anapaestic,10
7063,when the queen of warm passions precedes the fair may,anapaestic,10
7064,when so custom prescribes and to follow old rules,anapaestic,10
7065,one half of mankind makes the other half fools,anapaestic,10
7066,from the town i first breath'd in i sally'd in haste,anapaestic,10
7067,thro' highgate and finchley and barnet i pass'd,anapaestic,10
7068,at st alban's i din'd with a laughing gay crew,anapaestic,10
7069,not complete was the set without tucker and you,anapaestic,10
7070,where the eighth of our harries deserted his mate,anapaestic,10
7071,and procur'd a full sentence against his old kate,anapaestic,10
7072,our brisk company supp'd while our wine gave a spring,anapaestic,10
7073,and tho' at the crown we ne'er thought of the king,anapaestic,10
7074,the morrow succeeding i got from my bed,anapaestic,10
7075,as a sheet all the roads were with snows overspread,anapaestic,10
7076,but the gods who will never abandon a poet,anapaestic,10
7077,as oft has been said condescended to show it,anapaestic,10
7078,in a coach and six horses the storm i defy'd,anapaestic,10
7079,and left by my friends thro' the tempest i ride,anapaestic,10
7080,newportpannel receiv'd me and gave me a dinner,anapaestic,10
7081,and a bed at northampton was press'd by a sinner,anapaestic,10
7082,no signs of fair weather the west chester coach,anapaestic,10
7083,at nine the next morning a welcome approach,anapaestic,10
7084,presents fresh example i travell'd all day,anapaestic,10
7085,at crick eat my dinner at coventry lay,anapaestic,10
7086,i tremble whene'er i reflect on the roads,anapaestic,10
7087,that lead to those dirty wormeaten abodes,anapaestic,10
7088,where a woman rode naked their taxes to clear,anapaestic,10
7089,and a taylor for peeping paid damnably dear,anapaestic,10
7090,for two parliaments fam'd which intail a disgrace,anapaestic,10
7091,and have left their foul manners to poison the place,anapaestic,10
7092,next morning the fun with a face of red hue,anapaestic,10
7093,had clear'd up th' expanse and array'd it in blue,anapaestic,10
7094,when i left the vile town 'gainst which ever i'll rail,anapaestic,10
7095,while meriden offers no humble regale,anapaestic,10
7096,but near mixal park din'd at house of mean fame,anapaestic,10
7097,and at night to the field of slain carcasses came,anapaestic,10
7098,tho' full old are thy tow'rs yet receive my just praise,anapaestic,10
7099,may thy ale be recorded and live in my lays,anapaestic,10
7100,thy gothic cathedral new homage still claims,anapaestic,10
7101,nor refuse i thy due tho' repair'd by king james,anapaestic,10
7102,i forgot to advise you the sky being clear,anapaestic,10
7103,'twas at coventry first i ascended my chair,anapaestic,10
7104,but alas on the morrow how dismal the sight,anapaestic,10
7105,for the day had assum'd all the horrors of night,anapaestic,10
7106,the clouds their gay visage had chang'd to a frown,anapaestic,10
7107,and in a white mantle cloath'd litchfield's old town,anapaestic,10
7108,but at noon all was o'er when intrepid and bold,anapaestic,10
7109,as a trainband commander or falstaff of old,anapaestic,10
7110,and proudly defying the wind and the snow,anapaestic,10
7111,when the danger was pass'd i determin'd to go,anapaestic,10
7112,at stone i repos'd but at ousley i din'd,anapaestic,10
7113,when our reck'ning was cheap and the landlord was kind,anapaestic,10
7114,next morning we sally'd and staffordshire lost,anapaestic,10
7115,but not ill entertain'd by a cestrian host,anapaestic,10
7116,on the banks of the wever at namptwich renown'd,anapaestic,10
7117,for an excellent brine pit our dinner we found,anapaestic,10
7118,the wine was not bad tho' the ale did displease,anapaestic,10
7119,and an unctuous desert was serv'd up of old cheese,anapaestic,10
7120,but as time will not tarry our course we resume,anapaestic,10
7121,and st george's dragoons take their seats in our room,anapaestic,10
7122,so travelling onwards with pleasure we see,anapaestic,10
7123,old caerleon so famous o'er looking the dee,anapaestic,10
7124,four days there we rested and blithsome and gay,anapaestic,10
7125,forgot the bad weather we met on the way,anapaestic,10
7126,then old chester farewel till i see thee again,anapaestic,10
7127,and can stroll thro' thy streets without dreading the rain,anapaestic,10
7128,may thy river still swell better pleas'd with his charge,anapaestic,10
7129,than when edgar was row'd by eight kings in his barge,anapaestic,10
7130,be the maidens all virtuous who drink of thy tide,anapaestic,10
7131,and each virgin in bloom be affianc'd a bride,anapaestic,10
7132,may the heart and the hand at the altar be join'd,anapaestic,10
7133,and no matron complain that a husband's unkind,anapaestic,10
7134,let their bounty to strangers refound in each song,anapaestic,10
7135,be barnstone their copy they cannot go wrong,anapaestic,10
7136,o'er the cuts of the river our tract we pursue,anapaestic,10
7137,and old flint in the prospect now rises to view,anapaestic,10
7138,how strange to behold here our language is fled,anapaestic,10
7139,to converse with these people's to talk to the dead,anapaestic,10
7140,and a turk or chinese is as well understood,anapaestic,10
7141,by these roisters who boast of cadwalladar's blood,anapaestic,10
7142,as an englishman here who is certainly undone,anapaestic,10
7143,if he thinks to make use of the language of london,anapaestic,10
7144,from flint we depart with our landlord and guide,anapaestic,10
7145,who show'd us that kindness which courts never try'd,anapaestic,10
7146,the castle where richard his grandeur laid down,anapaestic,10
7147,and betray'd his own life by surrend'ring the crown,anapaestic,10
7148,now the well we survey where a virgin of old,anapaestic,10
7149,to all flame but religion's was lifeless and cold,anapaestic,10
7150,when in vain princely cradoc had offer'd his bed,anapaestic,10
7151,the merciless heathen e'en chopp'd off her head,anapaestic,10
7152,hence the stones are distain'd with the colour of blood,anapaestic,10
7153,and each cripple is cur'd who will bathe in the flood,anapaestic,10
7154,thus the rankest absurdity brain can conceive,anapaestic,10
7155,superstition imposes and crowds will believe,anapaestic,10
7156,turn from legends and nonsense to see a gay sight,anapaestic,10
7157,where the meadows of clewyn the senses delight,anapaestic,10
7158,and excuse that i aim not to point out the place,anapaestic,10
7159,lest my numbers too lowly the landscape disgrace,anapaestic,10
7160,at rhydland we dine and a castle we view,anapaestic,10
7161,whose founder i'd name if the founder i knew,anapaestic,10
7162,but our host gives the word and we hurry away,anapaestic,10
7163,lest the length of the journey outrun the short day,anapaestic,10
7164,now ascend penmenrose oh beware as you rise,anapaestic,10
7165,what a prospect of horror what dreadful surprize,anapaestic,10
7166,see that height more sublime which no footsteps e'er try'd,anapaestic,10
7167,there the ocean roars loudly how awful his pride,anapaestic,10
7168,how narrow the path observe where you tread,anapaestic,10
7169,nor stumble the feet nor grow dizzy the head,anapaestic,10
7170,if you slip not mankind can avert your sad doom,anapaestic,10
7171,dash'd against the rough rocks and the sea for your tomb,anapaestic,10
7172,the danger is past and now conway's broad beech,anapaestic,10
7173,fatigu'd and dismay'd with great gladness we reach,anapaestic,10
7174,in a leaky old boat we were wafted safe o'er,anapaestic,10
7175,tho' two drunkards our steersmen to th' opposite shore,anapaestic,10
7176,here the town and the river are both of a name,anapaestic,10
7177,and boast the first edward who rais'd her to fame,anapaestic,10
7178,there a supper was order'd which no one could touch,anapaestic,10
7179,this too little was boil'd and that roasted too much,anapaestic,10
7180,to his chamber full hungry each pilgrim retreats,anapaestic,10
7181,and forgets his lost meal 'twixt a pair of welch sheets,anapaestic,10
7182,a castle hard by i with pleasure behold,anapaestic,10
7183,which kings had long dwelt in or giants of old,anapaestic,10
7184,but the daw and each nightbird now builds up her nest,anapaestic,10
7185,and with clamours and shrieks the old mansion infest,anapaestic,10
7186,we waken'd at four and our host left us here,anapaestic,10
7187,as the worst ways were past so but small was our fear,anapaestic,10
7188,we follow'd our route and cross'd penmenmaur'sside,anapaestic,10
7189,where the prudent will walk but the bolder will ride,anapaestic,10
7190,still above us old rocks seem to threaten a fall,anapaestic,10
7191,and present to spectators the form of a wall,anapaestic,10
7192,now bangor we reach oh if e'er thou hadst fame,anapaestic,10
7193,tho' lawn sleeves thou bestow'st on my life 'tis a shame,anapaestic,10
7194,there we cross o'er an arm of the sea and carouse,anapaestic,10
7195,on the opposite shore at an excellent house,anapaestic,10
7196,thro' anglesea's island we rattle our chaise,anapaestic,10
7197,while the goats all in wonder seem on us to gaze,anapaestic,10
7198,for be pleas'd to observe and with diligence note,anapaestic,10
7199,that 'twas here first in wales that i met with a goat,anapaestic,10
7200,o'er roads rough and craggy our journey we sped,anapaestic,10
7201,nor baited again 'till we reach'd holyhead,anapaestic,10
7202,the next day at noon in the wyndham we sail,anapaestic,10
7203,and the packet danc'd brisk with a prosperous gale,anapaestic,10
7204,we at ten past the bar in the wherry confin'd,anapaestic,10
7205,which swims on no water and sails with no wind,anapaestic,10
7206,'till near two we sate cursing in vain they may row,anapaestic,10
7207,not a snail is so sluggish nor tortoise so slow,anapaestic,10
7208,'till a boat took us in and at length set us down,anapaestic,10
7209,at the quay of st george in st patrick's chief town,anapaestic,10
7210,thence i wrote to my friend nor believe what those say,anapaestic,10
7211,or too fond to find fault or too wantonly gay,anapaestic,10
7212,who with taunts contumelious this island o'erload,anapaestic,10
7213,as with bogs and with blunders and nonsense full stow'd,anapaestic,10
7214,for believe me they live not unbless'd with good air,anapaestic,10
7215,and their daughters are beauteous and sons debonair,anapaestic,10
7216,here tho' bacchus too often displays his red face,anapaestic,10
7217,yet minerva he holds in the strictest embrace,anapaestic,10
7218,nor the maiden is coy ev'ry charm to resign,anapaestic,10
7219,and the ivy and laurel peep forth from the vine,anapaestic,10
7220,thus i've told you in verse the whole progress i took,anapaestic,10
7221,as true as if sworn in full court on the book,anapaestic,10
7222,let me know how in london you measure your time,anapaestic,10
7223,'twill be welcome in prose but twice welcome in rhyme,anapaestic,10
7829,tho' the seasons must alter ah yet let me find,anapaestic,10
7830,what all must confess to be rare,anapaestic,10
7831,a female still chearful and faithful and kind,anapaestic,10
7832,the blessings of autumn to share,anapaestic,10
7833,let one side of our cottage a flourishing vine,anapaestic,10
7834,overspread with its branches and shade,anapaestic,10
7835,whose clusters appear more transparent and fine,anapaestic,10
7836,as its leaves are beginning to sade,anapaestic,10
7837,when the fruit makes the branches bend down with its load,anapaestic,10
7838,in our orchard surrounded with pales,anapaestic,10
7839,in a bed of clean straw let our apples be stow'd,anapaestic,10
7840,for a tart that in winter regales,anapaestic,10
7841,when the vapours that rise from the earth in the morn,anapaestic,10
7842,seem to hang on its surface like smoak,anapaestic,10
7843,'till dispers'd by the sun that gilds over the corn,anapaestic,10
7844,within doors let us prattle and joke,anapaestic,10
7845,but when we see clear all the hues of the leaves,anapaestic,10
7846,and at work in the fields are all hands,anapaestic,10
7847,some in reaping the wheat others binding the sheaves,anapaestic,10
7848,let us carelesly stroll o'er the lands,anapaestic,10
7849,how pleasing the sight of the toiling they make,anapaestic,10
7850,to collect what kind nature has sent,anapaestic,10
7851,heaven grant we may not of their labour partake,anapaestic,10
7852,but oh give us their happy content,anapaestic,10
7853,and sometimes on a bank under shade by a brook,anapaestic,10
7854,let us silently sit at our ease,anapaestic,10
7855,and there gaze on the stream till the fish on the hook,anapaestic,10
7856,struggles hard to procure its release,anapaestic,10
7857,and now when the husbandman sings harvest home,anapaestic,10
7858,and the corn's all got into the house,anapaestic,10
7859,when the long wish'd for time of their meeting is come,anapaestic,10
7860,to frolic and feast and carouse,anapaestic,10
7861,when the leaves from the trees are begun to be shed,anapaestic,10
7862,and are leaving the branches all bare,anapaestic,10
7863,either strew'd at the roots shrivell'd wither'd and dead,anapaestic,10
7864,or else blown to and fro in the air,anapaestic,10
7865,when the ways are so miry that bogs they might seem,anapaestic,10
7866,and the axletree's ready to break,anapaestic,10
7867,while the waggoner whistles in stopping his team,anapaestic,10
7868,and then claps the poor jades on the neck,anapaestic,10
7869,in the morning let's follow the cry of the hounds,anapaestic,10
7870,or the fearful young covey beset,anapaestic,10
7871,which tho' skulking in stubble and weeds on the grounds,anapaestic,10
7872,are becoming a prey to the net,anapaestic,10
7873,let's enjoy all the pleasure retirement affords,anapaestic,10
7874,still amus'd with these innocent sports,anapaestic,10
7875,nor once envy the pomp of fine ladies and lords,anapaestic,10
7876,with their grand entertainments in courts,anapaestic,10
7877,in the evening when lovers are leaning on stiles,anapaestic,10
7878,deep engag'd in some amorous chat,anapaestic,10
7879,and 'tis very well known by his grin and her smiles,anapaestic,10
7880,what they both have a mind to be at,anapaestic,10
7881,to our dwelling tho' homely wellpleas'd to repair,anapaestic,10
7882,let our mutual endearments revive,anapaestic,10
7883,and let no single action or look but declare,anapaestic,10
7884,how contented and happy we live,anapaestic,10
7885,should ideas arise that may ruffle the soul,anapaestic,10
7886,let soft music the phantoms remove,anapaestic,10
7887,for 'tis harmony only has force to controul,anapaestic,10
7888,and unite all the passions in love,anapaestic,10
7889,with her eyes but half open her cap all awry,anapaestic,10
7890,when the lass is preparing for bed,anapaestic,10
7891,and the sleepy dull clown who sits nodding just by,anapaestic,10
7892,sometimes rouzes and scratches his head,anapaestic,10
7893,in the night when 'tis cloudy and rainy and dark,anapaestic,10
7894,and the labourers snore as they lie,anapaestic,10
7895,not a noise to disturb us unless a dog bark,anapaestic,10
7896,in the farm or the village hard by,anapaestic,10
7897,at the time of sweet rest and of quiet like this,anapaestic,10
7898,ere our eyes are clos'd up in their lids,anapaestic,10
7899,let us welcome the season and taste of that bliss,anapaestic,10
7900,which the sunshine and daylight forbids,anapaestic,10
7903,a female still cheerful and faithful and kind,anapaestic,10
7908,as its leaves are beginning to fade,anapaestic,10
7914,seem to hang on its surface like smoke,anapaestic,10
7920,let us carelesly strole o'er the lands,anapaestic,10
8808,hark hark 'tis a voice from the tomb,anapaestic,10
8809,come lucy it cries come away,anapaestic,10
8810,the grave of thy colin has room,anapaestic,10
8811,to rest thee beside his cold clay,anapaestic,10
8812,i come my dear shepherd i come,anapaestic,10
8813,ye friends and companions adieu,anapaestic,10
8814,i haste to my colin's dark home,anapaestic,10
8815,to die on his bosom so true,anapaestic,10
8816,all mournful the midnight bell rung,anapaestic,10
8817,when lucy sad lucy arose,anapaestic,10
8818,and forth to the green turf she sprung,anapaestic,10
8819,where colin's pale ashes repose,anapaestic,10
8820,all wet with the night's chilling dew,anapaestic,10
8821,her bosom embrac'd the cold ground,anapaestic,10
8822,while stormy winds over her blew,anapaestic,10
8823,and nightravens croak'd all around,anapaestic,10
8824,how long my lov'd colin she cry'd,anapaestic,10
8825,how long must thy lucy complain,anapaestic,10
8826,how long shall the grave my love hide,anapaestic,10
8827,how long ere it join us again,anapaestic,10
8828,for thee thy fond shepherdess liv'd,anapaestic,10
8829,with thee o'er the world would she fly,anapaestic,10
8830,for thee has she sorrow'd and griev'd,anapaestic,10
8831,for thee would she lie down and die,anapaestic,10
8832,alas what avails it how dear,anapaestic,10
8833,thy lucy was once to her swain,anapaestic,10
8834,her face like the lily so fair,anapaestic,10
8835,and eyes that gave light to the plain,anapaestic,10
8836,the shepherd that lov'd her is gone,anapaestic,10
8837,that face and those eyes charm no more,anapaestic,10
8838,and lucy forgot and alone,anapaestic,10
8839,to death shall her colin deplore,anapaestic,10
8840,while thus she lay sunk in despair,anapaestic,10
8841,and mourn'd to the echoes around,anapaestic,10
8842,inflam'd all at once grew the air,anapaestic,10
8843,and thunder shook dreadful the ground,anapaestic,10
8844,i hear the kind call and obey,anapaestic,10
8845,o colin receive me she cried,anapaestic,10
8846,then breathing a groan o'er his clay,anapaestic,10
8847,she hung on his tombstone and died,anapaestic,10
8848,ye shepherds so careless and gay,anapaestic,10
8849,who sport with the nymphs of the plain,anapaestic,10
8850,take heed lest you frolic away,anapaestic,10
8851,the peace you can never regain,anapaestic,10
8852,let not folly your bosoms annoy,anapaestic,10
8853,and of love the dear mischief beware,anapaestic,10
8854,you may think 'tis all sunshine and joy,anapaestic,10
8855,i know 'its o'ershadow'd with care,anapaestic,10
8856,love's morning how blithsome it shines,anapaestic,10
8857,with an aspect deceitfully fair,anapaestic,10
8858,its day oft in sorrow declines,anapaestic,10
8859,and it sets in the night of despair,anapaestic,10
8860,hope paints the gay scene to the sight,anapaestic,10
8861,while fancy her visions bestows,anapaestic,10
8862,and gilds every dream with delight,anapaestic,10
8863,but to wake us to sensible woes,anapaestic,10
8864,how hard is my lot to complain,anapaestic,10
8865,of a nymph whom i yet must adore,anapaestic,10
8866,tho' she love not her shepherd again,anapaestic,10
8867,her damon must love her the more,anapaestic,10
8868,for it was not the pride of her sex,anapaestic,10
8869,that treated his vows with disdain,anapaestic,10
8870,for it was not the pleasure to vex,anapaestic,10
8871,that made her delude her fond swain,anapaestic,10
8872,'twas his the fair nymph to behold,anapaestic,10
8873,he hop'd and he rashly believ'd,anapaestic,10
8874,'twas hers to be fatally cold,anapaestic,10
8875,he lov'd and was fondly deceiv'd,anapaestic,10
8876,for such is of lovers the doom,anapaestic,10
8877,while passions their reason beguile,anapaestic,10
8878,'tis warrant enough to presume,anapaestic,10
8879,if they catch but a look or a smile,anapaestic,10
8880,yet surely my phillis would seem,anapaestic,10
8881,to prize me most shepherds above,anapaestic,10
8882,but that might be only esteem,anapaestic,10
8883,while i foolishly construed it love,anapaestic,10
8884,yet others like damon believ'd,anapaestic,10
8885,the nymph might have favour'd her swain,anapaestic,10
8886,and others like him were deceiv'd,anapaestic,10
8887,like him tho' they cannot complain,anapaestic,10
8888,of phyllis was always my song,anapaestic,10
8889,for she was my pride and my care,anapaestic,10
8890,and the folks as we wander'd along,anapaestic,10
8891,would call us the conjugal pair,anapaestic,10
8892,they mark'd how i walk'd at her side,anapaestic,10
8893,how her hand to my bosom i prest,anapaestic,10
8894,each tender endearment i try'd,anapaestic,10
8895,and i thought none was ever so blest,anapaestic,10
8896,but now the delusion is o'er,anapaestic,10
8897,these daydreams of pleasure are fled,anapaestic,10
8898,now her damon is pleasing no more,anapaestic,10
8899,and the hopes of her shepherd are dead,anapaestic,10
8900,may he that my fair shall obtain,anapaestic,10
8901,may he as thy damon be true,anapaestic,10
8902,or haply thou'lt think of that swain,anapaestic,10
8903,who bids thee dear maiden adieu,anapaestic,10
8904,from lincoln to london rode forth our young squire,anapaestic,10
8905,to bring down a wife whom the swains might admire,anapaestic,10
8906,but in spite of whatever the mortal could say,anapaestic,10
8907,the goddess objected the length of the way,anapaestic,10
8908,to give up the op'ra the park and the ball,anapaestic,10
8909,for to view the stag's horns in an old country hall,anapaestic,10
8910,to have neither china nor india to see,anapaestic,10
8911,nor laceman to plague in a morning not she,anapaestic,10
8912,to relinquish the playhouse quin garrick and clive,anapaestic,10
8913,who by dint of mere humour had kept her alive,anapaestic,10
8914,to forego the full box for his lonesome abode,anapaestic,10
8915,o heav'ns she should faint she should die on the road,anapaestic,10
8916,to forget the gay fashions and gestures of france,anapaestic,10
8917,and to leave dear auguste in the midst of the dance,anapaestic,10
8918,and harlequin too 'twas in vain to require it,anapaestic,10
8919,and she wonder'd how folks had the face to desire it,anapaestic,10
8920,she might yield to resign the sweet singers of ruckholt,anapaestic,10
8921,where the citizenmatron regales with her cuckold,anapaestic,10
8922,but ranelagh soon would her footsteps recall,anapaestic,10
8923,and the music the lamps and the glare of vauxhall,anapaestic,10
8924,to be sure she could breathe no where else than in town,anapaestic,10
8925,thus she talk'd like a wit and he look'd like a clown,anapaestic,10
8926,but while honest harry despair'd to succeed,anapaestic,10
8927,a coach with a coronet trail'd her to tweed,anapaestic,10
10162,behold my amanda yon prodigal rose,anapaestic,10
10163,flinging forth all its sweets to each zephyr that blows,anapaestic,10
10164,while each breeze steals some odour or soft tint away,anapaestic,10
10165,and next sun may destroy what has pleas'd us today,anapaestic,10
10166,of beauty so lavish the too selfish eye,anapaestic,10
10167,leaves the flow'ret tho' blooming to droop and to die,anapaestic,10
10168,not so that sweet bud where fond nature bestows,anapaestic,10
10169,each promise of fragrance that flaunts in the rose,anapaestic,10
10170,with a blush seems to think she can veil every charm,anapaestic,10
10171,and artlessly deems not those blushes can harm,anapaestic,10
10172,while with delicate prudence it steals on the sight,anapaestic,10
10173,and comes forth as if frighten'd of giving delight,anapaestic,10

11634,how caesar with glory can govern and fight,anapaestic,10
11635,and lead haughty kings in his fetter,anapaestic,10

11639,so sparkling so merry and witty,anapaestic,10
11640,while you play with her hair that is carelessly curl'd,anapaestic,10
11641,while this way now that way she twitches,anapaestic,10
11642,of your teazing so kindly complaining no world,anapaestic,10

12063,took that care of their babes that he took of his horses,anapaestic,10
12064,he had these ay and fifty good qualities more,anapaestic,10
12065,but the business of tipling cou'd ne'er be got o'er,anapaestic,10
12066,so his master effectually mended the matter,anapaestic,10
12067,by hiring a man who drank nothing but water,anapaestic,10

23830,and andrew macgrumble insists that his wife,anapaestic,10
23831,shall ask pardon most humbly each hour of her life,anapaestic,10
23832,and he's right for since wedlock has made them both one,anapaestic,10

23842,that when years have roll'd on though your locks be turn'd grey,anapaestic,10
23843,though the rosebud is blown nay quite faded away,anapaestic,10
23844,tho' the canker of time should love's blossoms destroy,anapaestic,10
23845,yet as darby and joan you may still be wish'd joy,anapaestic,10

43327,tho' languid her beauty tho' feeble her ray,anapaestic,10
43328,yet still she's akin to the god of the day,anapaestic,10
43329,when susan like cynthia has finish'd her reign,anapaestic,10
43330,then charlotte like phoebus shall shine out again,anapaestic,10
43331,as catholic bigots fall humble before,anapaestic,10
43332,the pictures of those whom in heart they adore,anapaestic,10
43333,which tho' known to be nothing but canvas and paint,anapaestic,10
43334,yet are said to enliven their zeal to the saint,anapaestic,10
43335,so to susan i bow charming charlotte for she,anapaestic,10
43336,has just beauty enough to remind me of thee,anapaestic,10
43337,inconstant and faithless in love's the pretence,anapaestic,10
43338,on which you arraign me pray hear my defence,anapaestic,10
43339,such censures as these to my credit redound,anapaestic,10
43340,i acknowledge and thank a good appetite for't,anapaestic,10
43341,when ven'son and claret are not to be found,anapaestic,10
43342,i can make a good meal upon mutton and port,anapaestic,10
43343,tho'a highclear's so fine that a prince would not scorn it,anapaestic,10
43344,tho' nature and taste have combin'd to adorn it,anapaestic,10
43345,yet the artist that owns it wou'd think it severe,anapaestic,10
43346,were a law made to keep him there all round the year,anapaestic,10
43347,how enrag'd wou'd the rector ofb boscoville look,anapaestic,10
43348,if the king should enjoin him to read but one book,anapaestic,10
43349,and how would his audience their fortune bemoan,anapaestic,10
43350,if he gave them no sermons but what were his own,anapaestic,10
43351,'tis variety only makes appetite last,anapaestic,10
43352,and by changing our dishes we quicken our taste,anapaestic,10
44283,long was the great figg by the prizefighting swains,anapaestic,10
44284,sole monarch acknowledg'd of marybone plains,anapaestic,10
44285,to the towns far and near did his valour extend,anapaestic,10
44286,and swam down the river from thame to gravesend,anapaestic,10
44287,where liv'd mr sutton pipemaker by trade,anapaestic,10
44288,who hearing that figg was thought such a stout blade,anapaestic,10
44289,resolv'd to put in for a share of his fame,anapaestic,10
44290,and so sent to challenge the champion of thame,anapaestic,10
44291,with alternate advantage two trials had past,anapaestic,10
44292,when they fought out the rubbers on wednesday last,anapaestic,10
44293,to see such a contest the house was so full,anapaestic,10
44294,there hardly was room left to thrust in your skull,anapaestic,10
44295,with a prelude of cudgells we first were saluted,anapaestic,10
44296,and two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted,anapaestic,10
44297,till weary at last with inferior disasters,anapaestic,10
44298,all the company cry'd come the masters the masters,anapaestic,10
44299,whereupon the bold sutton first mounted the stage,anapaestic,10
44300,made his honours as usual and yearn'd to engage,anapaestic,10
44301,then figg with a visage so fierce yet sedate,anapaestic,10
44302,came and enter'd the lists with his freshshaven pate,anapaestic,10
44303,their arms were encircled with armigers too,anapaestic,10
44304,with a red ribbon sutton's and figg's with a blue,anapaestic,10
44305,thus adorn'd the two heroes 'twixt shoulder and elbow,anapaestic,10
44306,shook hands and went to 't and the word it was bilboe,anapaestic,10
44307,sure such a concern in the eyes of spectators,anapaestic,10
44308,was never yet seen in our amphitheatres,anapaestic,10
44309,our commons and peers from their several places,anapaestic,10
44310,to half an inch distance all pointed their faces,anapaestic,10
44311,while the rays of old phoebus that shot thro' the skylight,anapaestic,10
44312,seem'd to make on the stage a new kind of twilight,anapaestic,10
44313,and the gods without doubt if one cou'd but have seen 'em,anapaestic,10
44314,were peeping there thro' to do justice between 'em,anapaestic,10
44315,figg struck the first stroke and with such a vast fury,anapaestic,10
44316,that he broke his huge weapon in twain i assure you,anapaestic,10
44317,and if his brave rival this blow had not warded,anapaestic,10
44318,his head from his shoulders had quite been discarded,anapaestic,10
44319,figg arm'd him again and they took t' other tilt,anapaestic,10
44320,and then sutton's blade ran away from its hilt,anapaestic,10
44321,the weapons were frighted but as for the men,anapaestic,10
44322,in truth they ne'er minded but at it again,anapaestic,10
44323,such a force in their blows you'd have thought it a wonder,anapaestic,10
44324,every stroke they receiv'd did not cleave 'em asunder,anapaestic,10
44325,yet so great was their courage so equal their skill,anapaestic,10
44326,that they both seem'd as safe as a thief in a mill,anapaestic,10
44327,while in doubtful attention dame victory stood,anapaestic,10
44328,and which side to take cou'd not tell for her blood,anapaestic,10
44329,but remain'd like the ass 'twixt the bundles of hay,anapaestic,10
44330,without ever stirring an inch either way,anapaestic,10
44331,till jove to the gods signified his intention,anapaestic,10
44332,in a speech that he made 'em too tedious to mention,anapaestic,10
44333,but the upshot on 't was that at that very bout,anapaestic,10
44334,from a wound in figg's side the hot blood spouted out,anapaestic,10
44335,her ladyship then seem'd to think the case plain,anapaestic,10
44336,but figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain,anapaestic,10
44337,shew'd the gash and appeal'd to the company round,anapaestic,10
44338,if his own broken sword had not given him the wound,anapaestic,10
44339,that bruises and wounds a man's spirit shou'd touch,anapaestic,10
44340,with danger so little with honour so much,anapaestic,10
44341,well they both took a dram and return'd to the battle,anapaestic,10
44342,and with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle,anapaestic,10
44343,while sutton's right arm was observed to bleed,anapaestic,10
44344,by a touch from his rival so jove had decreed,anapaestic,10
44345,just enough for to shew that his blood was not icor,anapaestic,10
44346,but made up like figg's of the common redliquor,anapaestic,10
44347,again they both rush'd with as equal a fire on,anapaestic,10
44348,'till the company cry'd hold enough of cold iron,anapaestic,10
44349,to the quarterstaff now lads so first having dram'd it,anapaestic,10
44350,they took to their woods and i' faith never sham'd it,anapaestic,10
44351,the first bout they had was so fair and so handsome,anapaestic,10
44352,that to make a fair bargain was worth a king's ransom,anapaestic,10
44353,and sutton such bangs on his neighbour imparted,anapaestic,10
44354,wou'd have made any fibres but figg's to have smarted,anapaestic,10
44355,then after that bout they went on to another,anapaestic,10
44356,but the matter must end on some fashion or other,anapaestic,10
44357,so jove told the gods he hath made a decree,anapaestic,10
44358,that figg shou'd hit sutton a stroke on the knee,anapaestic,10
44359,tho' sutton disabled as soon as he hit him,anapaestic,10
44360,wou'd still have fought on but jove wou'd not permit him,anapaestic,10
44361,'twas his fate not his fault that constrain'd him to yield,anapaestic,10
44362,and thus the great figg became lord of the field,anapaestic,10
44649,old plumb who tho' blest in his kentish retreat,anapaestic,10
44650,still thrives by his oilshop in leadenhallstreet,anapaestic,10
44651,with a portugal merchant a knight by creation,anapaestic,10
44652,from a borough in cornwall receiv'd invitation,anapaestic,10
44653,wellassur'd of each vote well equip't from the alley,anapaestic,10
44654,in quest of electionadventures they sally,anapaestic,10
44655,tho' much they discours'd the long way to beguile,anapaestic,10
44656,of the earthquakes the jews and the change of the stile,anapaestic,10
44657,of the irish the stocks and the lott'ry committee,anapaestic,10
44658,they came silent and tir'd into exeter city,anapaestic,10
44659,some books prithee landlord to pass a dull hour,anapaestic,10
44660,no nonsense of parsons or methodists sour,anapaestic,10
44661,no poetical stuff a damn'd jingle of rhimes,anapaestic,10
44662,but some pamphlet that's new and a touch on the times,anapaestic,10
44663,o lord says mine host you may hunt the town round,anapaestic,10
44664,i question if any such thing can be found,anapaestic,10
44665,i never was ask'd for a book by a guest,anapaestic,10
44666,and i'm sure i have all the great folk in the west,anapaestic,10
44667,none of these to my knowledge e'er call'd for a book,anapaestic,10
44668,but see sir the woman with fish and the cook,anapaestic,10
44669,here's the fattest of carp shall we dress you a brace,anapaestic,10
44670,would you have any soals or a mullet or plaice,anapaestic,10
44671,a place quoth the knight we must have to be sure,anapaestic,10
44672,but first let us see that our borough's secure,anapaestic,10
44673,we'll talk of the place when we've settled the poll,anapaestic,10
44674,they may dress us for supper the mullet and soal,anapaestic,10
44675,but do you my good landlord look over your shelves,anapaestic,10
44676,for a book we must have we're so tired of ourselves,anapaestic,10
44677,in troth sir i ne'er had a book in my life,anapaestic,10
44678,but the prayer book and bible i bought for my wife,anapaestic,10
44679,well the bible must do but who don't you take in,anapaestic,10
44680,some monthly collection the new magazine,anapaestic,10
44681,the bible was brought and laid out on the table,anapaestic,10
44682,and open'd at jotham's most apposite fable,anapaestic,10
44683,sir freeport began with this verse tho' no rhime,anapaestic,10
44684,the trees of the forest went forth on a time,anapaestic,10
44685,to what purpose our candidates scarce could expect,anapaestic,10
44686,for it was not they found to transplant but elect,anapaestic,10
44687,to the olive and figtree their deputies came,anapaestic,10
44688,but by both were refus'd and their answer the same,anapaestic,10
44689,quoth the olive shall i leave my fatness and oil,anapaestic,10
44690,for an unthankful office a dignified toil,anapaestic,10
44691,shall i leave quoth the figtree my sweetness and fruit,anapaestic,10
44692,to be envy'd or slav'd in so vain a pursuit,anapaestic,10
44693,thus rebuff'd and surpriz'd they apply'd to the vine,anapaestic,10
44694,he answer'd shall i leave my grapes and my wine,anapaestic,10
44695,wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man,anapaestic,10
44696,to be made or the tool or the head of a clan,anapaestic,10
44697,at last as it always falls out in a scramble,anapaestic,10
44698,the mob gave the cry for a bramble a bramble,anapaestic,10
44699,a bramble for ever o chance unexpected,anapaestic,10
44700,but bramble prevail'd and was duly elected,anapaestic,10
44701,o ho quoth the knight with a look most profound,anapaestic,10
44702,now i see there's some good in good books to be found,anapaestic,10
44703,i wish i had read this same bible before,anapaestic,10
44704,of long miles at the least 'twould have sav'd us fourscore,anapaestic,10
44705,you plumb with your olives and oil might have staid,anapaestic,10
44706,and myself might have tarried my wines to unlade,anapaestic,10
44707,what have merchants to do from their business to ramble,anapaestic,10
44708,your electioneererrant should still be a bramble,anapaestic,10
44709,thus ended at once the wise comment on jotham,anapaestic,10

45132,did he torture his head or his bosom with fire,anapaestic,10
45133,was his neck in a portable pillory cas'd,anapaestic,10
45134,did he fasten a chain to his leg or his waist,anapaestic,10
45135,no his holiness rose to this sovereign pitch,anapaestic,10
45136,by the merit of running long nails in his breech,anapaestic,10

45146,with an heart to my country devoted and warm,anapaestic,10
45147,i give to the poor and i lend to the rich,anapaestic,10
45148,but how many nails do you run in your breech,anapaestic,10
45149,with submission i speak to your rev'rence's tail,anapaestic,10
45150,but mine has no taste for a tenpenny nail,anapaestic,10
45151,well i'll pray to our prophet and get you prefer'd,anapaestic,10
45152,though no farther expect than to heaven the third,anapaestic,10
45153,with me in the thirtieth your seat to obtain,anapaestic,10
45154,you must qualify duly with hunger and pain,anapaestic,10
45155,with you in the thirtieth you impudent rogue,anapaestic,10
45156,can such wretches as you give to madness a vogue,anapaestic,10
45157,though the priesthood of fo on the vulgar impose,anapaestic,10
45158,by squinting whole years at the end of their nose,anapaestic,10
45159,though with cruel devices of mortification,anapaestic,10
45160,they adore a vain idol of modern creation,anapaestic,10
45161,does the god of the heav'ns such a service direct,anapaestic,10
45162,can his mercy approve a selfpunishing sect,anapaestic,10
45163,will his wisdom be worship'd with chains and with nails,anapaestic,10
45164,or e'er look for his rites in your noses and tails,anapaestic,10
45165,come along to my house and these penances leave,anapaestic,10
45166,give your belly a feast and your breech a reprieve,anapaestic,10
45167,this reas'ning unhing'd each fanatical notion,anapaestic,10
45168,and stagger'd our saint in his chair of promotion,anapaestic,10
45169,at length with reluctance he rose from his seat,anapaestic,10

51632,from the tongue the heart the hand,trochaic,8
51633,'tis to mortgage house and land,trochaic,8
51634,for a friend be sold a slave,trochaic,8

52281,half an angel man no more,trochaic,8
55522,quoth john to his teacher good sir if you please,anapaestic,10
55523,i wou'd beg your advice in a difficult case,anapaestic,10
55524,'tis a weighty concern that may hold one for life,anapaestic,10
55525,'tis in short the old story of taking a wife,anapaestic,10
55526,there's a pair of young damsels i'm proffer'd to marry,anapaestic,10
55527,and whether to choose puts me in a quandary,anapaestic,10
55528,they're alike in age family fortune and feature,anapaestic,10
55529,only one has more grace and the other goodnature,anapaestic,10
55530,as for that says the teacher goodnature and love,anapaestic,10
55531,and sweetness of temper are gifts from above,anapaestic,10
55532,and as coming from thence we shou'd give 'em their due,anapaestic,10
55533,grace is a superior blessing 'tis true,anapaestic,10
55534,ay sir i remember an excellent sarment,anapaestic,10
55535,wherein all along you gave grace the preferment,anapaestic,10
55536,i shall never forget it as how you were telling,anapaestic,10
55537,that heaven resided where grace had its dwelling,anapaestic,10
55538,why john quoth the teacher that's true but alas,anapaestic,10
55539,what heaven can do is quite out of the case,anapaestic,10
55540,for by day and by night with the woman you wed,anapaestic,10
55541,'tis you that must board and 'tis you that must bed,anapaestic,10
55542,and a goodnatur'd girl may quickly grow gracious,anapaestic,10
55543,but a sourheaded saint will be ever vexatious,anapaestic,10
55767,who the purple ev'ning lie,trochaic,8

55774,come with all thy various hues,trochaic,8
55775,come and aid thy sister muse,trochaic,8
55776,now while phoebus riding high,trochaic,8

55782,grongar in whose silent shade,trochaic,8
55783,for the modest muses made,trochaic,8
55784,so oft i have the evening still,trochaic,8
55785,at the fountain of a rill,trochaic,8
55786,sate upon a flow'ry bed,trochaic,8
55787,with my hand beneath my head,trochaic,8
55788,while stray'd my eyes o'er towy's flood,trochaic,8
55789,over mead and over wood,trochaic,8
55790,from house to house from hill to hill,trochaic,8
55791,'till contemplation had her fill,trochaic,8
55792,about his chequer'd sides i wind,trochaic,8
55793,and leave his brooks and meads behind,trochaic,8
55794,and groves and grottoes where i lay,trochaic,8
55795,and vistoes shooting beams of day,trochaic,8
55796,wide and wider spreads the vale,trochaic,8
55797,as circles on a smooth canal,trochaic,8
55798,the mountains round unhappy fate,trochaic,8
55799,sooner or later all of height,trochaic,8
55800,withdraw their summits from the skies,trochaic,8
55801,and lessen as the others rise,trochaic,8
55802,still the prospect wider spreads,trochaic,8
55803,adds a thousand woods and meads,trochaic,8
55804,still it widens widens still,trochaic,8
55805,and sinks the newlyrisen hill,trochaic,8
55806,now i gain the mountain's brow,trochaic,8
55807,what a landskip lies below,trochaic,8
55808,no clouds no vapours intervene,trochaic,8
55809,but the gay the open scene,trochaic,8
55810,does the face of nature show,trochaic,8
55811,in all the hues of heaven's bow,trochaic,8
55812,and swelling to embrace the light,trochaic,8
55813,spreads around beneath the sight,trochaic,8
55814,old castles on the cliffs arise,trochaic,8
55815,proudly tow'ring in the skies,trochaic,8
55816,rushing from the woods the spires,trochaic,8
55817,seem from hence ascending fires,trochaic,8
55818,half his beams apollo sheds,trochaic,8
55819,on the yellow mountainheads,trochaic,8
55820,gilds the fleeces of the flocks,trochaic,8
55821,and glitters on the broken rocks,trochaic,8
55822,below me trees unnumber'd rise,trochaic,8
55823,beautiful in various dyes,trochaic,8
55824,the gloomy pine the poplar blue,trochaic,8
55825,the yellow beech the sable yew,trochaic,8
55826,the slender fir that taper grows,trochaic,8
55827,the sturdy oak with broadspread boughs,trochaic,8
55828,and beyond the purple grove,trochaic,8
55829,haunt of phillis queen of love,trochaic,8
55830,gaudy as the op'ning dawn,trochaic,8
55831,lies a long and level lawn,trochaic,8
55832,on which a dark hill steep and high,trochaic,8
55833,holds and charms the wand'ring eye,trochaic,8
55834,deep are his feet in towy's flood,trochaic,8
55835,his sides are cloath'd with waving wood,trochaic,8
55836,and ancient towers crown his brow,trochaic,8
55837,that cast an aweful look below,trochaic,8
55838,whose ragged walls the ivy creeps,trochaic,8
55839,and with her arms from falling keeps,trochaic,8
55840,so both a safety from the wind,trochaic,8
55841,on mutual dependence find,trochaic,8
55842,'tis now the raven's bleak abode,trochaic,8
55843,'tis now th' apartment of the toad,trochaic,8
55844,and there the fox securely feeds,trochaic,8
55845,and there the pois'nous adder breeds,trochaic,8
55846,conceal'd in ruins moss and weeds,trochaic,8
55847,while ever and anon there falls,trochaic,8
55848,huge heaps of hoary moulder'd walls,trochaic,8
55849,yet time has seen that lifts the low,trochaic,8
55850,and level lays the lofty brow,trochaic,8
55851,has seen this broken pile compleat,trochaic,8
55852,big with the vanity of state,trochaic,8
55853,but transient is the smile of fate,trochaic,8
55854,a little rule a little sway,trochaic,8
55855,a sun beam in a winter's day,trochaic,8
55856,is all the proud and mighty have,trochaic,8
55857,between the cradle and the grave,trochaic,8
55858,and see the rivers how they run,trochaic,8
55859,thro' woods and meads in shade and sun,trochaic,8
55860,sometimes swift sometimes slow,trochaic,8
55861,wave succeeding wave they go,trochaic,8
55862,a various journey to the deep,trochaic,8
55863,like human life to endless sleep,trochaic,8
55864,thus is nature's vesture wrought,trochaic,8
55865,to instruct our wand'ring thought,trochaic,8
55866,thus she dresses green and gay,trochaic,8
55867,to disperse our cares away,trochaic,8
55868,ever charming ever new,trochaic,8
55869,when will the landskip tire the view,trochaic,8
55870,the fountain's fall the river's flow,trochaic,8
55871,the woody vallies warm and low,trochaic,8
55872,the windy summit wild and high,trochaic,8
55873,roughly rushing on the sky,trochaic,8
55874,the pleasant seat the ruin'd tow'r,trochaic,8
55875,the naked rock the shady bow'r,trochaic,8
55876,the town and village dome and farm,trochaic,8
55877,each give each a double charm,trochaic,8
55878,as pearls upon an aethiop's arm,trochaic,8
55879,see on the mountain's southern side,trochaic,8
55880,where the prospect opens wide,trochaic,8
55881,where the evening gilds the tide,trochaic,8
55882,how close and small the hedges lie,trochaic,8
55883,what streaks of meadows cross the eye,trochaic,8
55884,a step methinks may pass the stream,trochaic,8
55885,so little distant dangers seem,trochaic,8
55886,so we mistake the future's face,trochaic,8
55887,ey'd thro' hope's deluding glass,trochaic,8
55888,as yon summits soft and fair,trochaic,8
55889,clad in colours of the air,trochaic,8
55890,which to those who journey near,trochaic,8
55891,barren brown and rough appear,trochaic,8
55892,still we tread the same coarse way,trochaic,8
55893,the present's still a cloudy day,trochaic,8
55894,o may i with myself agree,trochaic,8
55895,and never covet what i see,trochaic,8
55896,content me with an humble shade,trochaic,8
55897,my passions tam'd my wishes laid,trochaic,8
55898,for while our wishes wildly roll,trochaic,8
55899,we banish quiet from the soul,trochaic,8
55900,'tis thus the busy beat the air,trochaic,8
55901,and misers gather wealth and care,trochaic,8
55902,now ev'n now my joys run high,trochaic,8
55903,as on the mountainturf i lie,trochaic,8
55904,while the wanton zephyr sings,trochaic,8
55905,and in the vale perfumes his wings,trochaic,8
55906,while the waters murmur deep,trochaic,8
55907,while the shepherd charms his sheep,trochaic,8
55908,while the birds unbounded fly,trochaic,8
55909,and with musick fill the sky,trochaic,8
55911,be full ye courts be great who will,trochaic,8
55912,search for peace with all your skill,trochaic,8
55913,open wide the lofty door,trochaic,8
55914,seek her on the marble floor,trochaic,8
55915,in vain you search she is not there,trochaic,8
55916,in vain ye search the domes of care,trochaic,8
55917,grass and flowers quiet treads,trochaic,8
55918,on the meads and mountainheads,trochaic,8
55919,along with pleasure close ally'd,trochaic,8
55920,ever by each other's side,trochaic,8
55921,and often by the murm'ring rill,trochaic,8
55922,hears the thrush while all is still,trochaic,8
55923,within the groves of grongar hill,trochaic,8
56935,swains of high or low degree,trochaic,8
56936,poets peers whate'er you be,trochaic,8
56937,ye who pen the lofty lay,trochaic,8
56938,or who sigh and nothing say,trochaic,8
56939,ye who talk of flames and darts,trochaic,8
56940,radiant eyes and marble hearts,trochaic,8

56948,i sustain the tripping maid,trochaic,8
56949,easy tho' to all and free,trochaic,8
56950,yet she foots it but with me,trochaic,8
56951,or at church or at the play,trochaic,8
56952,if she ogle or she pray,trochaic,8
56953,when she trips along the meads,trochaic,8
56954,or on persian carpets treads,trochaic,8
56955,in the sprightly month of may,trochaic,8
56956,fatal month some authors say,trochaic,8
56957,i both morning noon and night,trochaic,8
56958,order all her steps aright,trochaic,8
56959,who durst say when i was by,trochaic,8
56960,stella ever trod awry,trochaic,8
56961,her support unto my end,trochaic,8
56962,if a pilgrim she should go,trochaic,8
56963,where the streams of jordan flow,trochaic,8
56964,i'll sustain her in the way,trochaic,8
56965,where the streams of jordan stray,trochaic,8
56966,weary tho' and faint she be,trochaic,8
56967,all her cares shall rest on me,trochaic,8
56968,venus in her shape and air,trochaic,8
56969,cruel tho' nor does she know,trochaic,8

56971,tall and comely tho' she be,trochaic,8
56972,owes she not an inch to me,trochaic,8
56973,me on whom she treads and tramples,trochaic,8
56974,o the force of ill examples,trochaic,8
56975,die forsaken lovers die,trochaic,8
56976,favour'd less tho' true as i,trochaic,8
56977,so's the heelpiece to the heel,trochaic,8
56978,true and constant and will never,trochaic,8
56979,from her shoe or slipper fever,trochaic,8
56980,till the sole as ah it must,trochaic,8
56981,seeks its resting place in dust,trochaic,8
56982,as from envy who is free,trochaic,8
56983,come pour out your last adieus,trochaic,8
56984,die and heelpiece stella's shoes,trochaic,8
57180,at the close of the day when the hamlet is still,anapaestic,10
57181,and mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove,anapaestic,10
57182,when nought but the torrent is heard on the hill,anapaestic,10
57183,and nought but the nightingale's song in the grove,anapaestic,10
57184,'twas then by the cave of a mountain reclin'd,anapaestic,10
57185,an hermit his nightly complaint thus began,anapaestic,10
57186,tho' mournful his voice his heart was resign'd,anapaestic,10
57187,he thought as a sage but he felt as a man,anapaestic,10
57188,ah why thus abandon'd to mourning and woe,anapaestic,10
57189,why thus lonely philomel slows thy sad strain,anapaestic,10
57190,for spring shall return and a lover bestow,anapaestic,10
57191,and thy bosom no trace of dejection retain,anapaestic,10
57192,yet if pity inspire thee ah cease not thy lay,anapaestic,10
57193,mourn sweetest complainer man calls thee to mourn,anapaestic,10
57194,o soothe him whose pleasures like thine pass away,anapaestic,10
57195,full swiftly they pass but they never return,anapaestic,10
57196,now gliding remote on the verge of the sky,anapaestic,10
57197,the moon half extinct her wan crescent displays,anapaestic,10
57198,yet lately i saw where majestic on high,anapaestic,10
57199,she shone and the stars were conceal'd in her rays,anapaestic,10
57200,roil on thou fair orb and with gladness pursue,anapaestic,10
57201,the path that conducts thee to splendor again,anapaestic,10
57202,but man's faded glory no change shall renew,anapaestic,10
57203,ah fool to exult in a glory so vain,anapaestic,10
57204,'tis dark and the landscape is lovely no more,anapaestic,10
57205,i mourn not ye woodlands i mourn not for you,anapaestic,10
57206,for morn shall return all your charms to restore,anapaestic,10
57207,perfum'd with fresh fragrance and glittering with dew,anapaestic,10
57208,nor yet for the ravage of winter i mourn,anapaestic,10
57209,kind nature the embryo blossoms shall save,anapaestic,10
57210,but when shall spring visit the mouldering urn,anapaestic,10
57211,oh when shall it dawn on the gloom of the grave,anapaestic,10
61771,see from yonder hill descending,trochaic,8
61772,hope with all her train attending,trochaic,8
61773,quips and cranks and wanton wiles,trochaic,8
61774,nods and becks and wreathed smiles,trochaic,8
61775,fancies light that tread on air,trochaic,8
61776,building fairy castles there,trochaic,8
61777,olus his harp new stringing,trochaic,8
61778,tuning to the breezes singing,trochaic,8
61779,zeph'rus sweeping softest chords,trochaic,8
61780,fancy setting airs to words,trochaic,8
61781,words that seem another sound,trochaic,8
61782,and lighter than a breath are found,trochaic,8
61783,here morpheus comes a wandering guest,trochaic,8
61784,by plaintive murmurs lull'd to rest,trochaic,8
61785,round him painted vapours stream,trochaic,8
61786,weaving soft the chequer'd dream,trochaic,8
61787,which on silken wings they spread,trochaic,8
61788,shaking o'er his drowsy head,trochaic,8
61789,subtile fumes waft round the brain,trochaic,8
61790,and fan these joys so light and vain,trochaic,8
61791,which soft slumber loves to dress,trochaic,8
61792,in long robes of happiness,trochaic,8
61793,see where come the dancing hours,trochaic,8
61794,sprinkling hope's gay path with flowers,trochaic,8
61795,thyme that loves the brown hill's side,trochaic,8
61796,heath in lasting colours dyed,trochaic,8
61797,feathery sprays that softly blow,trochaic,8
61798,and lead the sweet gales as they go,trochaic,8
61799,unheeded though the scented air,trochaic,8
61800,fragrance steals we know not where,trochaic,8
61801,sweet hope lightly dost thou tread,trochaic,8
61802,bending not the weak flower's head,trochaic,8
61803,watching every changeful scene,trochaic,8
61804,sliding gilded shows between,trochaic,8
61805,where new prospects open still,trochaic,8
61806,rising fair behind the hill,trochaic,8
61807,'tis true stern reason scorns thy sway,trochaic,8
61808,nor basks beneath thy sunny ray,trochaic,8
61809,nor hears thy accents clear and sweet,trochaic,8
61810,where sprightly airs and softness meet,trochaic,8
61811,mixing with harmonic chords,trochaic,8
61812,pouring melody on words,trochaic,8
61813,nor will his fix'd eye deign to glance,trochaic,8
61814,on the mirthful mazy dance,trochaic,8
61815,when the hours all hand in hand,trochaic,8
61816,link with thee a jocund band,trochaic,8
61817,when thy white robes float on air,trochaic,8
61818,catching rays that tremble there,trochaic,8
61819,tinted with the varying beam,trochaic,8
61820,ending in prismatic stream,trochaic,8
61821,on thy head a wreath of flowers,trochaic,8
61822,nods in time to dancing hours,trochaic,8
61823,featheryfooted trim and light,trochaic,8
61824,flitting round from morn till night,trochaic,8
61825,from morn till night thou gaily leads,trochaic,8
61826,through dark green woods and painted meads,trochaic,8
61827,with roseting'd cheeks and clear blue eye,trochaic,8
61828,looking through another sky,trochaic,8
61829,till we reach th' enamell'd lawn,trochaic,8
61830,round which a river journeys on,trochaic,8
61831,where many a bridge is taught to please,trochaic,8
61832,gothic eyes or gay chinese,trochaic,8

67160,in that eye where expression has sweetly been taught,anapaestic,10
67161,to paint a strong picture of reason and thought,anapaestic,10
67162,yet touch'd with such softness as leads us to know,anapaestic,10

67169,whose finger all rhetoric gives language to wire,anapaestic,10
67170,till the voice that we love ever closing the strain,anapaestic,10
67171,shall dwell on the ear till we hear it again,anapaestic,10
67172,then tell me no more that you know not to please,anapaestic,10
67173,with looks so engaging and manners like these,anapaestic,10
67174,thus the lily all meekness unconscious of power,anapaestic,10
67175,presumes not to vie with a loftier flower,anapaestic,10
67176,yet the lover of sweetness must own ere they part,anapaestic,10
67177,'tis the lily alone he could wear in his heart,anapaestic,10
67178,in the dream of the moment i call'd for the bowl,anapaestic,10
67179,but i found that a bumper can't reach the pure soul,anapaestic,10
67180,though fancy may sparkle as shines the gay glass,anapaestic,10
67181,or mirth and good humour shake hands as they pass,anapaestic,10
67182,yet right if i ween for the joys that are past,anapaestic,10

67194,i'm grown weary of wit who but dresses for show,anapaestic,10
67195,and strives still to sparkle as much as your beau,anapaestic,10
67196,for if he can shine though at dear friends' expense,anapaestic,10
67197,he will raise contributions on feeling and sense,anapaestic,10
67198,then learning is proud nor can trifle with ease,anapaestic,10
67199,though in this little life 'tis oft trifles that please,anapaestic,10
67200,unbending austerity wrapt up in self,anapaestic,10
67201,is so like a miser when hoarding his pelf,anapaestic,10
67202,strong reason's a warrior that fights out his way,anapaestic,10
67203,and seldom has leisure to rest or to play,anapaestic,10
67204,nay so rough has he grown unless great things are done,anapaestic,10
67205,he thinks that all useless went down the bright sun,anapaestic,10
67206,o 'tis gentle good humour that makes life so sweet,anapaestic,10
67207,and picks up the flowerets that garnish our feet,anapaestic,10

69152,i rest my title let the glorious prize,trochaic,8

69280,and selfsupported nor admit her train,trochaic,8
69281,proud independency and publick zeal,trochaic,8
69282,those factious demagogues the foes of kings,trochaic,8

69284,the foes of monarchy and are deceit,trochaic,8
69285,injustice and oppression qualities,trochaic,8
69286,becoming and expedient in a king,trochaic,8
69287,then know i not to govern but have nurs'd,trochaic,8
69288,for twice these fifteen years ev'n in my heart,trochaic,8
69289,a pois'nous viper nay unking'd myself,trochaic,8
69290,by yielding to restrain my sov'reign pow'r,trochaic,8
69291,with laws and charters of enfranchisement,trochaic,8
69292,not due it seems from monarchs to their slaves,trochaic,8
69293,but know vile counsellor of infamy,trochaic,8
69294,that i disdain thy politics those false,trochaic,8
69295,and shallow politics by which my sire,trochaic,8
69296,weak judging edward was betray'd to shame,trochaic,8
69297,and foul destruction while to such as thee,trochaic,8
69298,his ear and heart incautious he resign'd,trochaic,8
69299,and was indeed their slave not england's king,trochaic,8
69300,by maxims different far have i sustain'd,trochaic,8
69301,the strength and splendor of my regal state,trochaic,8
69302,on the broad basis of true wisdom fix'd,trochaic,8
69303,with solid firmness by encouraging,trochaic,8
69304,the gen'rous love of virtue and of fame,trochaic,8
69305,that source of valour pledge of victory,trochaic,8
69306,by granting to my subjects what indeed,trochaic,8
69307,is their inherent right security,trochaic,8
69308,the cheerful father of content and peace,trochaic,8
69309,of industry and opulence which fills,trochaic,8

69311,in willing subsidies that prince's care,trochaic,8
69312,who lays up treasure in his people's hearts,trochaic,8
69313,by holding with a firm impartial hand,trochaic,8
69314,the sleddy scale of justice not alone,trochaic,8
69315,betwixt my subjects in their private rights,trochaic,8
69316,but in the gen'ral more important cause,trochaic,8
69317,betwixt the crown and them the diff'rent claims,trochaic,8
69318,of freedom and of just prerogative,trochaic,8
69319,transgressing not myself by boundless pow'r,trochaic,8
69320,nor suff'ring others to transgress those laws,trochaic,8
69321,that in their golden chain together bind,trochaic,8
69322,for common good the whole united state,trochaic,8
69323,but more than all by guarding from contempt,trochaic,8
69324,or impious violation that supreme,trochaic,8

69336,by which my british crown i have advanc'd,trochaic,8
69337,above th' imperial diadem above,trochaic,8
69338,the pride of afric's or of asia's thrones,trochaic,8
69339,i wou'd not tell thee this but that thou seem'st,trochaic,8
69340,a stranger to my fame as to my realm,trochaic,8
69341,and to the real greatness of a king,trochaic,8
69342,whose sacred dignity by thee traduc'd,trochaic,8
69343,much it behoves a king to vindicate,trochaic,8
69344,not by rejecting only with disdain,trochaic,8
69345,thy arrogant pretensions but in thee,trochaic,8
69346,dishonouring and branding with reproach,trochaic,8
69347,thy tenets also the pernicious lore,trochaic,8
69348,of tyrants and usurpers which thy tongue,trochaic,8
69349,blaspheming justice government and law,trochaic,8
69350,hath in a land of freedom dar'd to vent,trochaic,8
69351,hence from my kingdom with thy quickest speed,trochaic,8
69352,lest the revenge of an insulted king,trochaic,8
69353,with sudden ruin intercept thy flight,trochaic,8
69354,permit me edward to thy royal voice,trochaic,8
69355,to add my suffrage also and with thee,trochaic,8
69356,protest against this coward policy,trochaic,8
69357,that meanly skulks behind opprobrious fraud,trochaic,8
69358,and low unprincely artifice i feel,trochaic,8
69359,a virtue in my heart a gen'rous pride,trochaic,8
69360,that tells me kings were cloath'd with majesty,trochaic,8
69361,encircled with authority rever'd,trochaic,8
69362,and almost deify'd to teach them thence,trochaic,8
69363,that goodness and the saving attributes,trochaic,8
69364,of heav'n become their office justice chief,trochaic,8
69365,and truth the virtue of heroic minds,trochaic,8
69366,which were it banish'd from all other breasts,trochaic,8
69367,should dwell for ever in the hearts of kings,trochaic,8
69368,behold in us great king the ancient priests,trochaic,8
69369,and judges of this land the druids old,trochaic,8
69370,who late in borrow'd characters have stood,trochaic,8
69371,before thy sage tribunal to prefer,trochaic,8
69372,the claims of valour wealth nobility,trochaic,8
69373,and those soft specious flatt'rers who beneath,trochaic,8
69374,the rosy wreath of pleasure and of love,trochaic,8
69375,conceal the sickly and disgustful brow,trochaic,8
69376,of riot and debauch and often win,trochaic,8
69377,from weak unmanly princes the rich prize,trochaic,8
69378,to virtue due and wisdom not to these,trochaic,8
69379,the cankers of a state but least of all,trochaic,8
69380,due to that traytor of his king and country,trochaic,8
69381,who lab'ring to build up the regal throne,trochaic,8
69382,beyond its due proportion and the strength,trochaic,8
69383,of those foundations which the laws have laid,trochaic,8
69384,o'erwhelms the people and at once o'erturns,trochaic,8
69385,his royal master places him at best,trochaic,8
69386,on an uneasy tott'ring pinnacle,trochaic,8
69387,the mark of execration and reproach,trochaic,8
69388,these claims hast thou rejected like a king,trochaic,8
69389,discerning in mankind and knowing well,trochaic,8
69390,the value of his favours like a king,trochaic,8
69391,deserving the high office of the judge,trochaic,8
69392,and arbiter of europe like a king,trochaic,8
69393,equal to his great fame and worth the care,trochaic,8
69394,of those immortal spirits who this day,trochaic,8
69395,have quitted their celestial residence,trochaic,8
69396,to view and to approve thy glorious deeds,trochaic,8
69397,but edward be not thou amaz'd to find,trochaic,8
69398,that those who lately for thy favour su'd,trochaic,8
69399,were not the personages they assum'd,trochaic,8
69400,o king thou art beset with counterfeits,trochaic,8
69401,the very opposites to us who seem,trochaic,8
69402,far better than they are for flattery,trochaic,8
69403,cameleonlike accommodates with care,trochaic,8
69404,to the courthue his changeful countenance,trochaic,8
69405,and when a prince is brave magnanimous,trochaic,8
69406,and high in spirit then ambition wears,trochaic,8
69407,a face of dignity and nothing breathes,trochaic,8
69408,but lofty enterprizes conquest pow'r,trochaic,8
69409,and schemes of glory to the sov'reign ear,trochaic,8
69410,pretending love and care for his renown,trochaic,8
69411,with more than duteous zeal of these beware,trochaic,8
69412,for as the theban queen in fables old,trochaic,8
69413,was by the specious guile of fraudful jove,trochaic,8
69414,in her amphitryon's form to guilt betray'd,trochaic,8
69415,so by these counterfeits are kings seduc'd,trochaic,8
69416,ev'n in the most belov'd suspectless shapes,trochaic,8
69417,to take a traytor to their royal arms,trochaic,8
69418,but thou shalt know them edward by their works,trochaic,8
69419,and of this truth be most assur'd that he,trochaic,8
69420,who in his private commerce with mankind,trochaic,8
69421,is mean dishonest interested false,trochaic,8
69422,can ne'er be true to thee nor can he love,trochaic,8
69423,his prince who feels not for his country's good,trochaic,8
69424,thus warn'd we leave thee mighty prince be firm,trochaic,8
69425,be constant in the paths of fair renown,trochaic,8
69426,think it thy duty to revere thyself,trochaic,8
69427,the sacred laws of chivalry the wise,trochaic,8
69428,injunctions by thy order laid on all,trochaic,8
69429,the garter'd knights so shall thy fame remain,trochaic,8
69430,the great example of all future kings,trochaic,8
69431,farewell for lo the genius of thy realm,trochaic,8

69437,where in the glitter of unnumber'd worlds,trochaic,8
69438,that like to isles of various magnitudes,trochaic,8
69439,float in the ocean of unbounded space,trochaic,8
69440,on my invisible arial throne,trochaic,8
69441,i sit attended with a radiant band,trochaic,8
69442,of spirits immortal whose pure essences,trochaic,8
69443,while clad in human shapes on earth they dwelt,trochaic,8
69444,thro' the dull clay of gross mortality,trochaic,8
69445,disclos'd their heav'nly vigour and burst forth,trochaic,8
69446,in godlike virtues and heroic deeds,trochaic,8
69447,their albion gracing with as fair a growth,trochaic,8
69448,of fame as e'er enrich'd imperial rome,trochaic,8
69449,thence ripe for heav'n and immortality,trochaic,8
69450,to me the genius of this happy isle,trochaic,8
69451,they fly and claim the meed of their desert,trochaic,8
69452,celestial crowns and everliving praise,trochaic,8
69453,recorded in the songs of heav'nly bards,trochaic,8
69454,that round my throne their hymns of triumph sing,trochaic,8
69455,attuning to the sweet harmonious spheres,trochaic,8
69456,their undiscording lyres and voice divine,trochaic,8
69457,nor thus remov'd to heav'n and thus employ'd,trochaic,8
69458,in careless raptures wont they to forget,trochaic,8
69459,their native country and the public weal,trochaic,8
69460,to which on earth their labours and their lives,trochaic,8
69461,they once devoted but pursuing still,trochaic,8
69462,the bent and habit of their souls with me,trochaic,8
69463,they watch the british empire still intent,trochaic,8
69464,to check alternately th' incroaching waves,trochaic,8
69465,of regal pow'r and popular liberty,trochaic,8
69466,i chief attentive near the royal throne,trochaic,8
69467,take up my watchful station to infuse,trochaic,8

69470,to relish honest tho' unpleasing truth,trochaic,8
69471,thus am i always tho' invisible,trochaic,8
69472,attendant edward on thy glorious deeds,trochaic,8
69473,but on this solemn day have i vouchsaf'd,trochaic,8
69474,to manifest my presence to declare,trochaic,8
69475,not in those whispers which have often spoke,trochaic,8
69476,peace to thy conscious heart but audibly,trochaic,8
69477,and evident to all th' assent of heav'n,trochaic,8
69478,to the great business which hath gather'd here,trochaic,8
69479,this troop of princes from all nations round,trochaic,8

69856,and teach them to respect their country's fame,trochaic,8
69883,when i heard you were landed i flew to the nine,anapaestic,10
69884,intreating their aid to invite you to dine,anapaestic,10
69885,they told me i came on that errand too late,anapaestic,10
69886,for you were engag'd by the rich and the great,anapaestic,10
69887,already said i they were speedy indeed,anapaestic,10
69888,however i'll try and i hope to succeed,anapaestic,10
69889,those creatures of power who your levee attend,anapaestic,10
69890,if your father were out their conge's would end,anapaestic,10
69891,tho' your personal merit is great 'tis allow'd,anapaestic,10
69892,'tis the son of the statesman that weighs with the croud,anapaestic,10
69893,i expect not a place nor hope for a pension,anapaestic,10
69894,the love of the muse is my only pretension,anapaestic,10
69895,i hate to abuse and i never can flatter,anapaestic,10
69896,i write for no party nor either bespatter,anapaestic,10
69897,from the lands of parnassus the rents are illpaid,anapaestic,10
69898,and england has cruelly cramp'd us in trade,anapaestic,10
69899,so look not for china or service of plate,anapaestic,10
69900,or ought that is costly to tempt you to eat,anapaestic,10
69901,yet a way to engage you i think i have hit on,anapaestic,10
69902,i mean to remember our friends in greatbritain,anapaestic,10
69903,two bottles of wine and two dishes i'll give,anapaestic,10
69904,then fly from the crouds that oppress you and live,anapaestic,10
69905,the first glass shall welcome you sir to our coast,anapaestic,10
69906,and dear lady conway shall be my next toast,anapaestic,10
69907,with mirth and good humour i'll make up the treat,anapaestic,10
69908,i know you're too wise to love dining in state,anapaestic,10
70001,though low is my cot and the scene all around,anapaestic,10
70002,yet here even here it is thought may be found,anapaestic,10
70003,when aurora walks forth and collects her perfume,anapaestic,10
70004,her eye can look down just as fond to illume,anapaestic,10
70005,all nature beholding she smiles as she sees,anapaestic,10
70006,as she looks at the lustre that darts through the trees,anapaestic,10
70007,if such things to observe while beneath the dark oak,anapaestic,10
70008,bid them haste while the dryads the songsters invoke,anapaestic,10
70009,for as yet the rude catch from the briar may be borne,anapaestic,10
70010,since we yet can remember the harsh wounding thorn,anapaestic,10
70011,but soon yellow autumn the green leaves shall stain,anapaestic,10
70012,though now whetting scythes the gay season proclaim,anapaestic,10
70013,yet nature still changing that season shall bring,anapaestic,10
70014,when the gadding gay woodbine no longer shall cling,anapaestic,10
70015,with you i must own should the glow of the plain,anapaestic,10
70016,though fond of the scene i no more would complain,anapaestic,10
70017,and without them how oft have i sigh'd as i view'd,anapaestic,10
70018,thy regrets silly heart were too fondly renew'd,anapaestic,10
70019,what joy would i say can these beauties bestow,anapaestic,10
70020,though nature shed incense wherever i go,anapaestic,10
70021,for ah i have found in the bosom alone,anapaestic,10
70022,if we make not this cellliving goddess our own,anapaestic,10
70023,for fancy that fairy will darken the glade,anapaestic,10
70024,will heighten or lessen the falling cascade,anapaestic,10
70025,yet still there's a nymph with as magical powers,anapaestic,10
70026,and she even she can hand round the dull hours,anapaestic,10
70027,what though she is rural and best loves the grove,anapaestic,10
70028,yet not to one spot does she fasten her love,anapaestic,10
70029,she rambles about and i meet her at eve,anapaestic,10
70030,at noon in the shade help her chaplets to weave,anapaestic,10
70031,to such favour i've got that my friends she will guide,anapaestic,10
70032,that they shall not be weary when set by my side,anapaestic,10
70221,deck'd with rays of purple light,trochaic,8
70222,hither cupid wing thy flight,trochaic,8
70223,through the pure unclouded sky,trochaic,8
70224,let thy shafts unnumber'd fly,trochaic,8
70225,bid the warblers of the grove,trochaic,8
70226,bow before the shrine of love,trochaic,8
70227,and with thy resistless dart,trochaic,8
70228,pierce o pierce each youthful heart,trochaic,8
70229,hark how round thy hallow'd shrine,trochaic,8
70230,sweetly chaunt the tuneful nine,trochaic,8
70231,o'er the green enamel'd plains,trochaic,8
70232,pouring all their magic strains,trochaic,8
70233,phoebus now with fervid rays,trochaic,8
70234,lights thy altar's holy blaze,trochaic,8
70235,and touching soft his magic lyre,trochaic,8
70236,joins the sweet aonian choir,trochaic,8
74134,on the banks of the severn a desperate maid,anapaestic,10
74135,whom some shepherd neglecting his vows had betray'd,anapaestic,10
74136,stood resolving to banish all sense of the pain,anapaestic,10
74137,and pursue thro' her death a revenge on the swain,anapaestic,10
74138,since the gods and my passion at once he defies,anapaestic,10
74139,since his vanity lives whilst my character dies,anapaestic,10
74140,no more did she say will i trifle with fate,anapaestic,10
74141,but commit to the waves both my love and my hate,anapaestic,10
74142,and now to comply with that furious desire,anapaestic,10
74143,just ready to plunge and alone to expire,anapaestic,10
74144,some reflections on death and its terrors untry'd,anapaestic,10
74145,some scorn for the shepherd some flashings of pride,anapaestic,10
74146,at length pull'd her back and she cry'd why this strife,anapaestic,10
74147,since the swains are so many and i've but one life,anapaestic,10
74328,once on a time as old stories reherse,anapaestic,10
74329,a fryer would needs show his talent in latin,anapaestic,10
74330,but was sorely put to't in the midst of a verse,anapaestic,10
74331,when behold the next morning a wonderful riddle,anapaestic,10
74332,he found it was strangely fill'd in the middle,anapaestic,10
74333,let censuring criticks then think what they list on't,anapaestic,10
74334,who would not write verses with such an assistant,anapaestic,10
74335,this put me the fryar into an amazement,anapaestic,10
74336,that came through the keyhole or in at the casement,anapaestic,10
74337,howe'er it was civil in angel or elf,anapaestic,10
74338,for he ne're could have fill'd it so well of himself,anapaestic,10
74341,even so master doctor had puzzled his brains,anapaestic,10
74342,he had mixt little wit with a great deal of pains,anapaestic,10
74343,and tho' some malicious young spirit did do't,anapaestic,10
74344,you may know by the hand it had no cloven foot,anapaestic,10
74347,dear colin prevent my warm blushes,anapaestic,10
74348,since how can i speak without pain,anapaestic,10
74349,my eyes have oft told you their wishes,anapaestic,10
74350,ah can't you their meaning explain,anapaestic,10
74351,my passion wou'd lose by expression,anapaestic,10
74352,and you too might cruelly blame,anapaestic,10
74353,then don't you expect a confession,anapaestic,10
74354,of what is too tender to name,anapaestic,10
74355,since yours is the province of speaking,anapaestic,10
74356,why shou'd you expect it of me,anapaestic,10
74357,our wishes shou'd be in our keeping,anapaestic,10
74358,'till you tell us what they shou'd be,anapaestic,10
74359,then quickly why don't you discover,anapaestic,10
74360,did your breast feel tortures like mine,anapaestic,10
74361,eyes need not tell over and over,anapaestic,10
74362,what i in my bosom consine,anapaestic,10
74373,i sigh and lament me in vain,anapaestic,10
74374,alas it increases my pain,anapaestic,10
74375,through the grates of my prison i see,anapaestic,10
74376,my heart how it pants to be free,anapaestic,10
74377,ye roofs where cold damps and dismay,anapaestic,10
74378,how comfortless passes the day,anapaestic,10
74379,the owls from the battlements cry,anapaestic,10
74380,'o mary prepare thee to die',anapaestic,10
74381,unchang'd by the rigors of fate,anapaestic,10
74382,though fortune has clouded my state,anapaestic,10
74383,false woman in ages to come,anapaestic,10
74384,and when we are cold in the tomb,anapaestic,10
74385,on the brow of a hill a young shepherdess dwelt,anapaestic,10
74386,who no pangs of ambition or love had e'er felt,anapaestic,10
74387,for a few sober maxims still ran in her head,anapaestic,10
74388,that'twas better to earn ere she eat her brown bread,anapaestic,10
74389,that to rise with the lark was conducive to health,anapaestic,10
74390,and to folks in a cottage contentment was wealth,anapaestic,10
74391,who at church and at market was reckon'd a beau,anapaestic,10
74392,had many times try'd o'er her heart to prevail,anapaestic,10
74393,and would rest on his pitchfork to tell her his tale,anapaestic,10
74394,with his winning behaviour he melted her heart,anapaestic,10
74395,but quite artless herself she suspected no art,anapaestic,10
74396,he had sigh'd and protested had kneel'd and implor'd,anapaestic,10
74397,and could lye with the grandeur and air of a lord,anapaestic,10
74398,then her eyes he commended in language well drest,anapaestic,10
74399,and enlarg'd on the torments that troubled his breast,anapaestic,10
74400,'till his sighs and his tears had so wrought on her mind ',anapaestic,10
74401,that in downright compassion to love she inclin'd,anapaestic,10
74402,but as soon as he'd melted the ice of her breast,anapaestic,10
74403,all the flames of his love in a moment decreast,anapaestic,10
74404,and at noon he goes flaunting all over the vale,anapaestic,10
74405,where he boasts of his conquest to susan and nell,anapaestic,10
74406,tho' he sees her but seldom he's always in haste,anapaestic,10
74407,and if ever he mentions her makes her his jest,anapaestic,10
74408,all the day she goes sighing and hanging her head,anapaestic,10
74409,and her thoughts are so pester'd she scarce earns her bread,anapaestic,10
74410,the whole village cry shame when a milking she goes,anapaestic,10
74411,that so little affection is shew'd to the cows,anapaestic,10
74412,but she heeds not their railing e'en let 'em rail on,anapaestic,10
74413,and a fig for the cows now her sweetheart is gone,anapaestic,10

74425,and will sing to my lass with the golden locks,anapaestic,10
74426,tho' o'er her white forehead the gilt tresses flow,anapaestic,10
74427,like the rays of the sun on a hillock of snow,anapaestic,10

96712,join'd in one continu'd round,trochaic,8
96713,now their plighted hands unbind,trochaic,8
96714,and such tangled mazes wind,trochaic,8
96715,as the quick eye can scarce pursue,trochaic,8
96716,and wou'd have puzzled that fam'd clue,trochaic,8
96717,which led th' athenian's unskill'd feet,trochaic,8
96718,thro' the labyrinth of crete,trochaic,8
96719,at the near approach of day,trochaic,8
96720,sudden the musick dies away,trochaic,8

103933,these virtues betray her extraction from heav'n,anapaestic,10
106712,what do scholars and bards and astronomers wise,anapaestic,10

106724,no nectar she drank no ambrosia she eat,anapaestic,10
106725,her cup was plain claret a chicken her meat,anapaestic,10
106726,nor wanted a cestus her bosom to grace,anapaestic,10
106727,for rd that night had lent her her face,anapaestic,10
108423,once a grove of sweet myrtles soft venus would rear,anapaestic,10
108424,'twas a green shade for hope in each change of the year,anapaestic,10
108425,hymen mark'd out the spot and would plant some sweet flower,anapaestic,10
108426,which cupid snatch'd up to set fire to the bower,anapaestic,10
108427,the taper burnt clear yet no leaf would consume,anapaestic,10
108428,it just warm'd the buds and increas'd their perfume,anapaestic,10

116703,while you my dear girls in your paradise stray,anapaestic,10
116704,diverting with innocent freedom the day,anapaestic,10
116705,i wander alone in a barbarous land,anapaestic,10
116706,half bak'd by the sun half blind by the sand,anapaestic,10
116707,then your wood too and grotto so swim in my sight,anapaestic,10
116708,they give me no respite by day nor by night,anapaestic,10
116709,no sooner asleep but i'm dreaming of you,anapaestic,10
116710,i am just wak'd from one wou'd to god it were true,anapaestic,10

116712,and had got lord knows how an estate of my own,anapaestic,10
116713,goodbye to plain tom i was rais'd a peg higher,anapaestic,10
116714,some call'd me his worship and others the squire,anapaestic,10
116715,'twas a place i remember exactly like easton,anapaestic,10
116716,a scene for an emperor's fancy to feast on,anapaestic,10
116717,there i built a fine house with great cost and great care,anapaestic,10
116718,your la'ships have form'd many such in the air,anapaestic,10
116719,not of stucco nor brick but as good portland stone,anapaestic,10
116720,as kent wou'd desire to be working upon,anapaestic,10
116721,the apartments not small nor monstrously great,anapaestic,10
116722,but chiefly for use and a little for state,anapaestic,10
116723,so begilt and becarv'd and with ornaments grac'd,anapaestic,10
116724,that ev'ry one said i'd an excellent taste,anapaestic,10
116725,here i liv'd like a king never hoarded my pelf,anapaestic,10
116726,kept a coach for my sisters a nag for myself,anapaestic,10
116727,with something that's good when our highclear friends come,anapaestic,10
116728,and spite of 'squire herbert a fire in each room,anapaestic,10
116729,a canal made for profit as well as for pleasure,anapaestic,10
116730,that's about let me see two acres in measure,anapaestic,10
116731,both the eye to delight and the table to crown,anapaestic,10
116732,with a jack or a perch when my uncles come down,anapaestic,10
116733,an exceeding great wood that's been set a great while,anapaestic,10
116734,in length near a league and in breadth near a mile,anapaestic,10
116735,there ev'ry dear girl her bright genius displays,anapaestic,10
116736,in a thousand fine whimsies a thousand fine ways,anapaestic,10
116737,o how charming the walks to my fancy appear,anapaestic,10
116738,what a number of temples and grottos are here,anapaestic,10
116739,my soul was transported to such an extreme,anapaestic,10
116740,that i leap'd up in raptures when lo 'twas a dream,anapaestic,10
116741,then vexing i chid the impertinent day,anapaestic,10
116742,for driving so sweet a delusion away,anapaestic,10
116743,thus spectres arise as by nursemaids we're told,anapaestic,10
116744,and hie to the place where they buried their gold,anapaestic,10
116745,there hov'ring around until morning remain,anapaestic,10
116746,then sadly return to their torments again,anapaestic,10
117194,ye shepherds who sport on the plain,anapaestic,10
117195,my heart was a stranger to pain,anapaestic,10
117196,when deck'd with his pipe and his crook,anapaestic,10
117197,so sweetly the shepherd did look,anapaestic,10
117198,but alas t'other day at the fair,anapaestic,10
117199,he bought ribbons for phillis's hair,anapaestic,10
117200,sweet songs to beguile the dull hours,anapaestic,10
117201,a posie of mayblowing flowers,anapaestic,10
117202,last week as they sat in the grove,anapaestic,10
117203,their converse i'm sure was of love,anapaestic,10
117204,i heard the soft words that he sung,anapaestic,10
117205,each accent that fell from his tongue,anapaestic,10
117206,my charmer said he is more fair,anapaestic,10
117207,what's thyme with her breath to compare,anapaestic,10
117208,the rose when compar'd with her cheek,anapaestic,10
117209,when sol thro' a shower doth break,anapaestic,10
117210,alas if they never had met,anapaestic,10
117211,i wish he would phillis forget,anapaestic,10
117212,each day wou'd i sing thro' the grove,anapaestic,10
117213,but if he has settled his love,anapaestic,10
117214,adieu to contentment and rest,anapaestic,10
117215,for i fear i can never be bless'd,anapaestic,10
117216,to the grave will i carry my truth,anapaestic,10
117217,be careful to shun the false youth,anapaestic,10
117218,come join all ye nymphs of the grove,anapaestic,10
117219,at length i have conquer'd my love,anapaestic,10
117220,my bow'r shall with chaplets be dress'd,anapaestic,10
117221,for my bosom no more is oppress'd,anapaestic,10
117222,oh jealousy merciless foe,anapaestic,10
117223,each day was a compound of woe,anapaestic,10
117224,i envied the nymphs and the swains,anapaestic,10
117225,because they were strangers to pain,anapaestic,10
117226,young daphne the sprightly and gay,anapaestic,10
117227,with damon did wantonly play,anapaestic,10
117228,i fear'd that her charms would beguile,anapaestic,10
117229,i could not allow him to smile,anapaestic,10
117230,gay colin by all is approv'd,anapaestic,10
117231,he has often declar'd that he lov'd,anapaestic,10
117232,but why do i muse on past woe,anapaestic,10
117233,what blessing can heaven bestow,anapaestic,10
117234,no danger or peril i fear,anapaestic,10
117235,while bless'd in the smiles of my dear,anapaestic,10
117236,together we sport all the day,anapaestic,10
117237,or else o'er the meadows we stray,anapaestic,10
117238,adieu to all anguish and care,anapaestic,10
117239,no longer will delia despair,anapaestic,10
117240,then join all ye nymphs of the grove,anapaestic,10
117242,ye shepherds so cheerful and gay,anapaestic,10
117243,whose flocks never carelessly roam,anapaestic,10
117244,should corydon's happen to stray,anapaestic,10
117245,oh call the poor wanderers home,anapaestic,10
117246,allow me to muse and to sigh,anapaestic,10
117247,nor talk of the change that ye find,anapaestic,10
117248,none once was so watchful as i,anapaestic,10
117249,i have left my dear phyllis behind,anapaestic,10
117250,now i know what it is to have strove,anapaestic,10
117251,with the torture of doubt and desire,anapaestic,10
117252,what it is to admire and to love,anapaestic,10
117253,and to leave her we love and admire,anapaestic,10
117254,ah lead forth my flock in the morn,anapaestic,10
117255,and the damps of each ev'ning repell,anapaestic,10
117256,alas i am faint and forlorn,anapaestic,10
117257,i have bade my dear phyllis farewell,anapaestic,10
117258,since phyllis vouchsaf'd me a look,anapaestic,10
117259,i never once dreamt of my vine,anapaestic,10
117260,may i lose both my pipe and my crook,anapaestic,10
117261,if i knew of a kid that was mine,anapaestic,10
117262,i priz'd every hour that went by,anapaestic,10
117263,beyond all that had pleas'd me before,anapaestic,10
117264,but now they are past and i sigh,anapaestic,10
117265,and i grieve that i priz'd them no more,anapaestic,10
117266,but why do i languish in vain,anapaestic,10
117267,why wander thus pensively here,anapaestic,10
117268,oh why did i come from the plain,anapaestic,10
117269,where i fed on the smiles of my dear,anapaestic,10
117270,they tell me my favourite maid,anapaestic,10
117271,the pride of that valley is flown,anapaestic,10
117272,alas where with her i have stray'd,anapaestic,10
117273,i could wander with pleasure alone,anapaestic,10
117274,when forc'd the fair nymph to forego,anapaestic,10
117275,what anguish i felt at my heart,anapaestic,10
117276,yet i thought but it might not be so,anapaestic,10
117277,'twas with pain that she saw me depart,anapaestic,10
117278,she gaz'd as i slowly withdrew,anapaestic,10
117279,my path i could hardly discern,anapaestic,10
117280,so sweetly she bade me adieu,anapaestic,10
117281,i thought that she bade me return,anapaestic,10
117282,the pilgrim that journeys all day,anapaestic,10
117283,to visit some fardistant shrine,anapaestic,10
117284,if he bear but a relique away,anapaestic,10
117285,is happy nor heard to repine,anapaestic,10
117286,thus widely remov'd from the fair,anapaestic,10
117287,where my vows my devotion i owe,anapaestic,10
117288,soft hope is the relique i bear,anapaestic,10
117289,and my solace wherever i go,anapaestic,10
117290,my banks they are furnish'd with bees,anapaestic,10
117291,whose murmur invites one to sleep,anapaestic,10
117292,my grottos are shaded with trees,anapaestic,10
117293,and my hills are whiteover with sheep,anapaestic,10
117294,i seldom have met with a loss,anapaestic,10
117295,such health do my fountains bestow,anapaestic,10
117296,my fountains all border'd with moss,anapaestic,10
117297,where the harebells and violets grow,anapaestic,10
117298,not a pine in my grove is there seen,anapaestic,10
117299,but with tendrils of woodbine is bound,anapaestic,10
117300,not a beech's more beautiful green,anapaestic,10
117301,but a sweetbriar twines it around,anapaestic,10
117302,not my fields in the prime of the year,anapaestic,10
117303,more charms than my cattle unfold,anapaestic,10
117304,not a brook that is limpid and clear,anapaestic,10
117305,but it glitters with fishes of gold,anapaestic,10
117306,one would think she might like to retire,anapaestic,10
117307,to the bow'r i have labour'd to rear,anapaestic,10
117308,not a shrub that i heard her admire,anapaestic,10
117309,but i hasted and planted it there,anapaestic,10
117310,o how sudden the jessamin strove,anapaestic,10
117311,with the lilac to render it gay,anapaestic,10
117312,already it calls for my love,anapaestic,10
117313,to prune the wild branches away,anapaestic,10
117314,from the plains from the woodlands and groves,anapaestic,10
117315,what strains of wild melody flow,anapaestic,10
117316,how the nightingales warble their loves,anapaestic,10
117317,from thickets of roses that blow,anapaestic,10
117318,and when her bright form shall appear,anapaestic,10
117319,each bird shall harmoniously join,anapaestic,10
117320,in a concert so soft and so clear,anapaestic,10
117321,as she may not be fond to resign,anapaestic,10
117322,i have found out a gift for my fair,anapaestic,10
117323,i have found where the woodpigeons breed,anapaestic,10
117324,but let me that plunder forbear,anapaestic,10
117325,she will say 'twas a barbarous deed,anapaestic,10
117326,for he ne'er could be true she aver'd,anapaestic,10
117327,who could rob a poor bird of its young,anapaestic,10
117328,and i lov'd her the more when i heard,anapaestic,10
117329,such tenderness fall from her tongue,anapaestic,10
117330,i have heard her with sweetness unfold,anapaestic,10
117331,how that pity was due to a dove,anapaestic,10
117332,that it ever attended the bold,anapaestic,10
117333,and she call'd it the sister of love,anapaestic,10
117334,but her words such a pleasure convey,anapaestic,10
117335,so much i her accents adore,anapaestic,10
117336,let her speak and whatever she say,anapaestic,10
117337,methinks i should love her the more,anapaestic,10
117338,can a bosom so gentle remain,anapaestic,10
117339,unmov'd when her corydon sighs,anapaestic,10
117340,will a nymph that is fond of the plain,anapaestic,10
117341,these plains and this valley despise,anapaestic,10
117342,dear regions of silence and shade,anapaestic,10
117343,soft scenes of contentment and ease,anapaestic,10
117344,where i could have pleasingly stray'd,anapaestic,10
117345,if aught in her absence could please,anapaestic,10
117346,but where does my phyllida stray,anapaestic,10
117347,and where are her grots and her bow'rs,anapaestic,10
117348,are the groves and the valleys as gay,anapaestic,10
117349,and the shepherds as gentle as ours,anapaestic,10
117350,the groves may perhaps be as fair,anapaestic,10
117351,and the face of the valleys as fine,anapaestic,10
117352,the swains may in manners compare,anapaestic,10
117353,but their love is not equal to mine,anapaestic,10
117354,why will you my passion reprove,anapaestic,10
117355,why term it a folly to grieve,anapaestic,10
117356,ere i shew you the charms of my love,anapaestic,10
117357,she is fairer than you can believe,anapaestic,10
117358,with her mien she enamours the brave,anapaestic,10
117359,with her wit she engages the free,anapaestic,10
117360,with her modesty pleases the grave,anapaestic,10
117361,she is ev'ry way pleasing to me,anapaestic,10
117362,o you that have been of her train,anapaestic,10
117363,come and join in my amorous lays,anapaestic,10
117364,i could lay down my life for the swain,anapaestic,10
117365,that will sing but a song in her praise,anapaestic,10
117366,when he sings may the nymphs of the town,anapaestic,10
117367,come trooping and listen the while,anapaestic,10
117368,nay on him let not phillida frown,anapaestic,10
117369,but i cannot allow her to smile,anapaestic,10
117370,for when paridel tries in the dance,anapaestic,10
117371,any favour with phyllis to find,anapaestic,10
117372,o how with one trivial glance,anapaestic,10
117373,might she ruin the peace of my mind,anapaestic,10
117374,in ringlets he dresses his hair,anapaestic,10
117375,and his crook is bestudded around,anapaestic,10
117376,and his pipe oh may phyllis beware,anapaestic,10
117377,of a magic there is in the sound,anapaestic,10
117378,'tis his with mock passion to glow,anapaestic,10
117379,'tis his in smooth tales to unfold,anapaestic,10
117380,how her face is as bright as the snow,anapaestic,10
117381,and her bosom be sure is as cold,anapaestic,10
117382,how the nightingales labour the strain,anapaestic,10
117383,with the notes of his charmer to vie,anapaestic,10
117384,how they vary their accents in vain,anapaestic,10
117385,repine at her triumphs and die,anapaestic,10
117386,to the grove or the garden he strays,anapaestic,10
117387,and pillages every sweet,anapaestic,10
117388,then suiting the wreath to his lays,anapaestic,10
117389,he throws it at phyllis's feet,anapaestic,10
117390,o phyllis he whispers more fair,anapaestic,10
117391,more sweet than the jessamin's flow'r,anapaestic,10
117392,what are pinks in a morn to compare,anapaestic,10
117393,what is eglantine after a show'r,anapaestic,10
117394,then the lily no longer is white,anapaestic,10
117395,then the rose is depriv'd of its bloom,anapaestic,10
117396,then the violets die with despight,anapaestic,10
117397,and the woodbines give up their perfume,anapaestic,10
117398,thus glide the soft numbers along,anapaestic,10
117399,and he fancies no shepherd his peer,anapaestic,10
117400,yet i never should envy the song,anapaestic,10
117401,were not phyllis to lend it an ear,anapaestic,10
117402,let his crook be with hyacinths bound,anapaestic,10
117403,so phyllis the trophy despise,anapaestic,10
117404,let his forehead with laurels be crown'd,anapaestic,10
117405,so they shine not in phillis's eyes,anapaestic,10
117406,the language that flows from the heart,anapaestic,10
117407,is a stranger to paridel's tongue,anapaestic,10
117408,yet may she beware of his art,anapaestic,10
117409,or sure i must envy the song,anapaestic,10
117410,ye shepherds give ear to my lay,anapaestic,10
117411,and take no more heed of my sheep,anapaestic,10
117412,they have nothing to do but to stray,anapaestic,10
117413,i have nothing to do but to weep,anapaestic,10
117414,yet do not my folly reprove,anapaestic,10
117415,she was fair and my passion begun,anapaestic,10
117416,she smil'd and i could not but love,anapaestic,10
117417,she is faithless and i am undone,anapaestic,10
117418,perhaps i was void of all thought,anapaestic,10
117419,perhaps it was plain to foresee,anapaestic,10
117420,that a nymph so compleat would be sought,anapaestic,10
117421,by a swain more engaging than me,anapaestic,10
117422,ah love ev'ry hope can inspire,anapaestic,10
117423,it banishes wisdom the while,anapaestic,10
117424,and the lip of the nymph we admire,anapaestic,10
117425,seems for ever adorn'd with a smile,anapaestic,10
117427,ye that witness the woes i endure,anapaestic,10
117428,let reason instruct you to shun,anapaestic,10
117429,what it cannot instruct you to cure,anapaestic,10
117430,beware how ye loiter in vain,anapaestic,10
117431,amid nymphs of an higher degree,anapaestic,10
117432,it is not for me to explain,anapaestic,10
117433,how fair and how fickle they be,anapaestic,10
117434,alas from the day that we met,anapaestic,10
117435,what hope of an end to my woes,anapaestic,10
117436,when i cannot endure to forget,anapaestic,10
117437,the glance that undid my repose,anapaestic,10
117438,yet time may diminish the pain,anapaestic,10
117439,the flow'r and the shrub and the tree,anapaestic,10
117440,which i rear'd for her pleasure in vain,anapaestic,10
117441,in time may have comfort for me,anapaestic,10
117442,the sweets of a dewsprinkled rose,anapaestic,10
117443,the sound of a murmuring stream,anapaestic,10
117444,the peace which from solitude flows,anapaestic,10
117445,henceforth shall be corydon's theme,anapaestic,10
117446,high transports are shewn to the sight,anapaestic,10
117447,but we are not to find them our own,anapaestic,10
117448,fate never bestow'd such delight,anapaestic,10
117449,as i with my phyllis had known,anapaestic,10
117450,o ye woods spread your branches apace,anapaestic,10
117451,to your deepest recesses i fly,anapaestic,10
117452,i would hide with the beasts of the chace,anapaestic,10
117453,i would vanish from every eye,anapaestic,10
117454,yet my reed shall resound thro' the grove,anapaestic,10
117455,with the same sad complaint it begun,anapaestic,10
117456,how she smil'd and i could not but love,anapaestic,10
117457,was faithless and i am undone,anapaestic,10
117458,pretty nymph within this shade,trochaic,8
117459,whilst the flocks to rest are laid,trochaic,8
117460,whilst the world dissolves in heat,trochaic,8
117461,take this cool and flow'ry seat,trochaic,8
117462,and with pleasing talk a while,trochaic,8
117463,let us two the time beguile,trochaic,8
117464,tho' thou here no shepherd see,trochaic,8
117465,to encline his humble knee,trochaic,8
117466,or with melancholy lays,trochaic,8
117467,sing thy dangerous beauty's praise,trochaic,8
117468,nymph with thee i here wou'd stay,trochaic,8
117469,but have heard that on this day,trochaic,8
117470,near those beeches scarce in view,trochaic,8
117471,all the swains some mirth pursue,trochaic,8
117472,to whose meeting now i haste,trochaic,8
117473,solitude do's life but waste,trochaic,8
117474,prithee but a moment stay,trochaic,8
117475,no my chaplet wou'd decay,trochaic,8
117476,ev'ry drooping flow'r wou'd mourn,trochaic,8
117477,and wrong the face they shou'd adorn,trochaic,8
117478,i can tell thee tho' so fair,trochaic,8
117479,and dress'd with all that rural care,trochaic,8
117480,most of the admiring swains,trochaic,8
117481,will be absent from the plains,trochaic,8
117482,gay sylvander in the dance,trochaic,8
117483,meeting with a shrew'd mischance,trochaic,8
117484,to his cabin's now confin'd,trochaic,8
117485,by mopsus who the strain did bind,trochaic,8
117486,damon through the woods do's stray,trochaic,8
117487,where his kids have lost their way,trochaic,8
117488,young narcissus iv'ry brow,trochaic,8
117489,rac'd by a malicious bough,trochaic,8
117490,keeps the girilish boy from sight,trochaic,8
117491,till time shall do his beauty right,trochaic,8
117492,where's alexis,trochaic,8
117493,lies extended on the grass,trochaic,8
117494,tears his garland raves despairs,trochaic,8
117495,mirth and harmony forswears,trochaic,8
117496,since he was this morning shown,trochaic,8
117497,that delia must not be his own,trochaic,8
117498,foolish swain such love to place,trochaic,8
117499,on any but dorinda's face,trochaic,8
117500,hasty nymph i said not so,trochaic,8
117501,no but i thy meaning know,trochaic,8
117502,ev'ry shepherd thou wou'd'st have,trochaic,8
117503,not thy lover but thy slave,trochaic,8
117504,to encrease thy captive train,trochaic,8
117505,never to be lov'd again,trochaic,8
117506,but since all are now away,trochaic,8
117508,no the strangers from the vale,trochaic,8
117509,sure will not this meeting fail,trochaic,8
117510,graceful one the other fair,trochaic,8
117511,he too with the pensive air,trochaic,8
117512,told me ere he came this way,trochaic,8
117513,he was wont to look more gay,trochaic,8
117514,see how pride thy heart inclines,trochaic,8
117515,to think for thee that shepherd pines,trochaic,8
117516,when those words that reach'd thy ear,trochaic,8
117517,chloe was design'd to hear,trochaic,8
117518,chloe who did near thee stand,trochaic,8
117519,and his more speaking looks command,trochaic,8
117520,now thy envy makes me smile,trochaic,8
117521,that indeed were worth his while,trochaic,8
117522,chloe next thyself decay'd,trochaic,8
117523,and no more a courted maid,trochaic,8
117524,next myself young nymph forbear,trochaic,8
117525,still the swains allow me fair,trochaic,8
117526,tho' not what i was that day,trochaic,8
117527,when colon bore the prize away,trochaic,8
117529,till all the evening sports are past,trochaic,8
117530,till no streak of light is seen,trochaic,8
117531,nor footstep prints the flow'ry green,trochaic,8
117532,what thou wert i need not know,trochaic,8
117533,what i am must haste to show,trochaic,8
117534,only this i now discern,trochaic,8

120487,with an offer of fortune and welltim'd it was,anapaestic,10
120488,for poets have seldom much rent from parnass',anapaestic,10
120489,cried my lord you'll excuse me but i have a reason,anapaestic,10
120490,why even this offer becomes out of season,anapaestic,10
120491,i've a new book of sonnets just ripe for the press,anapaestic,10
120492,upon the same plan as the last you may guess,anapaestic,10
120493,i have there all along made my laura a goddess,anapaestic,10

120495,while hebe minerva and twenty to boot,anapaestic,10
120496,with gifts all celestial have trick'd me her out,anapaestic,10
120497,now marriage my lord the whole charm would destroy,anapaestic,10
120498,and hurl her divinity quite from the sky,anapaestic,10
120499,to my cost i should find her no more than a woman,anapaestic,10
120500,and my sonnets alas would gain credit with no man,anapaestic,10
120585,a lady sent lately to one doctor drug,anapaestic,10
120586,to come in an instant and clyster poor pug,anapaestic,10
120587,as the fair one commanded he came at the word,anapaestic,10
120588,and did the grand office in tiewig and sword,anapaestic,10
120589,the affair being ended so sweet and so nice,anapaestic,10
120590,he held out his hand with you know ma'am my price,anapaestic,10
120591,your price says the lady why sir he's your brother,anapaestic,10
120592,and doctors must never take fees of each other,anapaestic,10
125879,if e'er in thy sight i found favour apollo,anapaestic,10
125880,defend me from all the disasters which follow,anapaestic,10
125881,from the knaves and the fools and the fops of the time,anapaestic,10
125882,from the drudges in prose and the triflers in rhyme,anapaestic,10
125883,from the pacthwork and toils of the royal sackbibber,anapaestic,10
125884,those dead birthday odes and the farces of cibber,anapaestic,10
125885,from servile attendance on men in high places,anapaestic,10
125886,their worships and honours and lordships and graces,anapaestic,10
125887,from long dedications to patrons unworthy,anapaestic,10

127143,to find out a punishment due to his fault,anapaestic,10
127144,old pluto had puzzled his brain,anapaestic,10
127145,but hell had not torments sufficient he thought,anapaestic,10
127146,so he gave him his wife back again,anapaestic,10
127147,but pity succeeding found place in his heart,anapaestic,10
127148,and pleas'd with his playing so well,anapaestic,10
127149,he took her again in reward of his art,anapaestic,10

128445,it sets off the sense of small poets the better,anapaestic,10
128446,when i've written in prose i often have found,anapaestic,10
128447,that my sense in a jumble of words was quite drown'd,anapaestic,10
128448,in verse as in armies that march o'er the plain,anapaestic,10
128449,the least man among them is seen without pain,anapaestic,10
128450,this they owe to good order it must be allow'd,anapaestic,10
128451,else men that are little are lost in a croud,anapaestic,10
128452,so much for simile now to be brief,anapaestic,10
128453,the following lines come to tell you my grief,anapaestic,10
128454,'tis well i can write for i scarcely can speak,anapaestic,10
128455,i'm so plagu'd with my teeth which eternally ake,anapaestic,10
128456,when the wind's in the point which opposes the south,anapaestic,10
128457,for fear of the cold i can't open my mouth,anapaestic,10
128458,and you know to the sex it must be a heartbreaking,anapaestic,10
128459,to have any distemper that keeps them from speaking,anapaestic,10
128460,when first i was silent a day and a night,anapaestic,10
128461,the women were all in a terrible fright,anapaestic,10
128462,supplications to jove in an instant they make,anapaestic,10
128463,avert the portent a woman not speak,anapaestic,10
128464,since poets are prophets and often have sung,anapaestic,10
128465,the last thing that dies in a woman's her tongue,anapaestic,10
128466,o jove for what crime is sapphira thus curst,anapaestic,10
128467,'tis plain by her breathing her tongue has dy'd first,anapaestic,10
128468,ye powers celestial tell mortals what cause,anapaestic,10
128469,occasions dame nature to break her own laws,anapaestic,10
128470,did the preacher live now from his text he must run,anapaestic,10
128471,and own there was something new under the sun,anapaestic,10
128472,o jove for the future this punishment spare,anapaestic,10
128473,and all other evils we'll willingly bear,anapaestic,10
128474,then they throng to my house and my maid they beseech,anapaestic,10
128475,to say if her mistress had quite lost her speech,anapaestic,10
128476,nell readily own'd what they heard was too true,anapaestic,10
128477,that today i was dumb give the devil his due,anapaestic,10
128478,and frankly confess'd were it always the case,anapaestic,10
128479,no servant could e'er have a happier place,anapaestic,10
128480,when they found it was fact they began all to fear me,anapaestic,10
128481,and dreading infection would scarcely come near me,anapaestic,10
128482,till a neighbour of mine who was famous for speeching,anapaestic,10
128483,bid them be of good cheer the disease was not catching,anapaestic,10
128484,and offer'd to prove from authors good store,anapaestic,10
128485,that the like case with this never happen'd before,anapaestic,10
128486,and if ages to come should resemble the past,anapaestic,10
128487,as 'twas the first instance it would be the last,anapaestic,10
128488,yet against this disorder we all ought to strive,anapaestic,10
128489,were i in her case i'd been bury'd alive,anapaestic,10
128490,were i one moment silent except in my bed,anapaestic,10
128491,my good natur'd husband would swear i was dead,anapaestic,10
128492,the next said her tongue was so much in her pow'r,anapaestic,10
128493,she was sullenly silent almost half an hour,anapaestic,10
128494,that to vex her good man she took this way to teaze him,anapaestic,10
128495,but soon left it off when she found it would please him,anapaestic,10
128496,and vow'd for the future she'd make the housering,anapaestic,10
128497,for when she was dumb he did nothing but sing,anapaestic,10
128498,quite tir'd with their talking i held down my head,anapaestic,10
128499,so she who sat next me cry'd out i was dead,anapaestic,10
128500,they call'd for cold water to throw in my face,anapaestic,10
128501,give her air give her air and cut open her lace,anapaestic,10
128502,says good neighbour nevil you're out of your wits,anapaestic,10
128503,she oft to my knowledge has these sullen fits,anapaestic,10
128504,let her husband come in and make one step that's wrong,anapaestic,10
128505,my life for't the woman will soon find her tongue,anapaestic,10
128506,you'll soon be convinc'd o' my conscience he's here,anapaestic,10
128507,why what's all this rout are you sullen my dear,anapaestic,10
128508,this struck them all silent which gave me some ease,anapaestic,10
128509,and made them imagine they'd got my disease,anapaestic,10
128510,so they hasted away in a terrible fright,anapaestic,10
128511,and left me in silence to pass the long night,anapaestic,10
128512,not the women alone were scar'd at my fate,anapaestic,10
128513,'twas reckon'd of dreadful portent to the state,anapaestic,10
128514,when the governors heard it they greatly were troubled,anapaestic,10
128515,and whilst i was silent the guards were all doubled,anapaestic,10
128516,the militia drums beat a perpetual alarm,anapaestic,10
128517,to rouze up the sons of the city to arm,anapaestic,10
128518,a story was rumour'd about from lambey,anapaestic,10
128519,of a powerful fleet that was seen off at sea,anapaestic,10
128520,with horror all list to the terrible tale,anapaestic,10
128521,the barristers tremble the judges grow pale,anapaestic,10
128522,to the castle the frighted nobility fly,anapaestic,10
128523,and the council were summon'd they could not tell why,anapaestic,10
128524,the clergy in crouds to the churches repair,anapaestic,10
128525,and armies embattled were seen in the air,anapaestic,10
128526,why they were in this fright i have lately been told,anapaestic,10
128527,it seems it was sung by a druid of old,anapaestic,10
128528,that the hanover race to greatbritain should come,anapaestic,10
128529,and sit on the throne till a woman grew dumb,anapaestic,10
128530,as soon as this prophecy reach'd the pretender,anapaestic,10
128531,he cry'd out my claim to the crown i surrender,anapaestic,10
128532,says richard to thomas and seem'd half afraid,anapaestic,10
128533,i am thinking to marry thy mistress's maid,anapaestic,10
128534,now because mrs martha to thee is well known,anapaestic,10
128535,i will do't if thou bidst me or let it alone,anapaestic,10
128536,nay don't make a jest on't 'tis no jest to me,anapaestic,10
128537,for faith i'm in earnest so prithee be free,anapaestic,10
128538,i have no fault to find with the girl since i knew her,anapaestic,10
128539,but i'd have thy advice ere i tye myself to her,anapaestic,10
128540,said thomas to richard to speak my opinion,anapaestic,10
128541,there is not such a bitch in king george's dominion,anapaestic,10
128542,and i firmly believe if thou knew'st her as i do,anapaestic,10
128543,thou would'st chuse out a whippingpost first to be ty'd to,anapaestic,10
128544,she's peevish she's thievish she's ugly she's old,anapaestic,10
128545,and a lyar and a fool and a slut and a scold,anapaestic,10
128546,next day richard hasten'd to church and was wed,anapaestic,10
128547,and ere night had inform'd her what thomas had said,anapaestic,10
132806,grown old and grown stupid you just think me fit,anapaestic,10
132807,to transcribe from my grandmother's book a receipt,anapaestic,10
132808,and a comfort it is to a wight in distress,anapaestic,10
132809,he's of some little use but he can't be of less,anapaestic,10
132810,were greater his talents you might ever command,anapaestic,10
132811,his head that's worth nought then his heart and his hand,anapaestic,10
132812,so your mandate obeying he sends you d'ye see,anapaestic,10
132813,the genuine receipt to make l'eau de la vie,anapaestic,10
132814,take seven large lemons and pare them as thin,anapaestic,10
132815,as a wafer or what is yet thinner your skin,anapaestic,10
132816,a quart of french brandy or rum is still better,anapaestic,10
132817,for you ne'er in receipts should stick close to the letter,anapaestic,10
132818,six ounces of sugar next take and pray mind,anapaestic,10
132819,the sugar must be the best doublerefin'd,anapaestic,10
132820,boil the sugar in near half a pint of spring water,anapaestic,10
132821,in the neat silver saucepan you bought for your daughter,anapaestic,10
132822,but be sure that the syrup you carefully skim,anapaestic,10
132823,while the scum as 'tis call'd rises up to the brim,anapaestic,10
132824,the fourth part of a pint you next must allow,anapaestic,10
132825,of new milk made as warm as it comes from the cow,anapaestic,10
132826,put the rinds of the lemons the milk and the syrup,anapaestic,10
132827,with the rum in a jar and give 'em a stir up,anapaestic,10
132828,and if you approve it you may add some perfume,anapaestic,10
132829,goastone or whatever you like in its room,anapaestic,10
132830,let it stand thus three days but remember to shake it,anapaestic,10
132831,and the closer you stop it the richer you make it,anapaestic,10
132832,then filter'd thro' paper 'twill sparkle and rise,anapaestic,10
132833,be as soft as your lips and as bright as your eyes,anapaestic,10
132834,last bottle it up and believe me the vicar,anapaestic,10
132835,of e himself ne'er drank better liquor,anapaestic,10
132836,in a word it excels by a million of odds,anapaestic,10
132837,the nectar your sister presents to the gods,anapaestic,10
132838,while the sighing crowd admire,trochaic,8
132839,all those dismal looks and fretting,trochaic,8
132840,long ago the worms have eat him,trochaic,8
132841,once again consult your toilette,trochaic,8
132842,so much weeping soon will spoil it,trochaic,8
132843,i like you was born a woman,trochaic,8
132844,the disease alas is common,trochaic,8
132845,all the morals that they tell us,trochaic,8
132846,chuse among the pretty fellows,trochaic,8
132847,prithee hear him every morning,trochaic,8
132848,once again at night returning,trochaic,8
133024,all attendants apart,anapaestic,10
133025,i examin'd my heart,anapaestic,10
133026,last night when i lay'd me to rest,anapaestic,10
133027,and methinks i'm inclin'd,anapaestic,10
133028,to a change of my mind,anapaestic,10
133029,for you know second thoughts are the best,anapaestic,10
133030,to retire from the crowd,anapaestic,10
133031,and make ourselves good,anapaestic,10
133032,by avoiding of every temptation,anapaestic,10
133033,is in truth to reveal,anapaestic,10
133034,what we'd better conceal,anapaestic,10
133035,that our passions want some regulation,anapaestic,10
133036,it will much more redound,anapaestic,10
133037,to our praise to be found,anapaestic,10
133038,in a world so abounding with evil,anapaestic,10
133039,unspotted and pure,anapaestic,10
133040,tho' not so demure,anapaestic,10
133041,as to wage open war with the devil,anapaestic,10
133042,then bidding farewell,anapaestic,10
133043,to the thoughts of a cell,anapaestic,10
133044,i'll prepare for a militant life,anapaestic,10
133045,and if brought to distress,anapaestic,10
133046,why then i'll confess,anapaestic,10
133047,and do penance in shape of a wife,anapaestic,10
133128,between nose and eyes a strange contest arose,anapaestic,10
133129,the spectacles set them unhappily wrong,anapaestic,10
133130,the point in dispute was as all the world knows,anapaestic,10
133131,to which the said spectacles ought to belong,anapaestic,10
133132,so the tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause,anapaestic,10
133133,with a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning,anapaestic,10
133134,while chief baron ear sat to balance the laws,anapaestic,10
133135,so fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning,anapaestic,10
133136,in behalf of the nose it will quickly appear,anapaestic,10
133137,and your lordship he said will undoubtedly find,anapaestic,10
133138,that the nose has had spectacles always in wear,anapaestic,10
133139,which amounts to possession time out of mind,anapaestic,10
133140,then holding the spectacles up to the court,anapaestic,10
133141,your lordship observes they are made with a straddle,anapaestic,10
133142,as wide as the ridge of the nose is in short,anapaestic,10
133143,design'd to sit close to it just like a saddle,anapaestic,10
133144,again would your lordship a moment suppose,anapaestic,10
133145,'tis a case that has happen'd and may be again,anapaestic,10
133146,that the visage or countenance had not a nose,anapaestic,10
133147,pray who wou'd or who cou'd wear spectacles then,anapaestic,10
133148,on the whole it appears and my argument shows,anapaestic,10
133149,with a reasoning the court will never condemn,anapaestic,10
133150,that the spectacles plainly were made for the nose,anapaestic,10
133151,and the nose was as plainly intended for them,anapaestic,10
133152,then shifting his side as a lawyer knows how,anapaestic,10
133153,he pleaded again in behalf of the eyes,anapaestic,10
133154,but what were his arguments few people know,anapaestic,10
133155,for the court did not think they were equally wise,anapaestic,10
133156,so his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone,anapaestic,10
133157,decisive and clear without one if or but,anapaestic,10
133158,that whenever the nose put his spectacles on,anapaestic,10
133159,by daylight or candlelight eyes should be shut,anapaestic,10
133252,the favours of fortune i once hop'd to gain,anapaestic,10
133253,and often invok'd her but ever in vain,anapaestic,10

133255,i flew to the muses in hopes of relief,anapaestic,10
133256,ah wretch that i was i might very well know,anapaestic,10
133257,'twas the method to make her for ever my foe,anapaestic,10
133258,they laugh'd at the goddess and bid me despise her,anapaestic,10
133259,but time and experience have made me grow wiser,anapaestic,10
133260,this unhappy mistake i resolve to repair,anapaestic,10
133261,o fortune thy votaries must persevere,anapaestic,10
133397,of old when scarron his companions invited,anapaestic,10
133398,each guest brought his dish and the feast was united,anapaestic,10

133413,at a dinner so various at such a repast,anapaestic,10
133414,who'd not be a glutton and stick to the last,anapaestic,10
133415,here waiter more wine let me sit while i'm able,anapaestic,10
133416,'till all my companions sink under the table,anapaestic,10

133418,let me ponder and tell what i think of the dead,anapaestic,10
133419,here lies the good dean reunited to earth,anapaestic,10
133420,who mixt reason with pleasure and wisdom with mirth,anapaestic,10
133421,if he had any faults he has left us in doubt,anapaestic,10
133422,at least in six weeks i could not find 'em out,anapaestic,10

133424,that slyboots was cursedly cunning to hide 'em,anapaestic,10
133425,here lies our good edmund whose genius was such,anapaestic,10
133426,we scarcely can praise it or blame it too much,anapaestic,10
133427,who born for the universe narrow'd his mind,anapaestic,10
133428,and to party gave up what was meant for mankind,anapaestic,10
133429,tho' fraught with all learning yet straining his throat,anapaestic,10
133430,to persuadem tommy townsend to lend him a vote,anapaestic,10
133431,who too deep for his hearers still went on refining,anapaestic,10
133432,and thought of convincing while they thought of dining,anapaestic,10
133433,tho' equal to all things for all things unfit,anapaestic,10
133434,too nice for a statesman too proud for a wit,anapaestic,10
133435,for a patriot too cool for a drudge disobedient,anapaestic,10
133436,and too fond of the right to pursue the expedient,anapaestic,10
133437,in short 'twas his fate unemploy'd or in place sir,anapaestic,10
133438,to eat mutton cold and cut blocks with a razor,anapaestic,10
133439,here lies honest william whose heart was a mint,anapaestic,10
133440,while the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't,anapaestic,10
133441,the pupil of impulse it forc'd him along,anapaestic,10

133452,now teazing and vexing yet laughing at all,anapaestic,10
133453,in short so provoking a devil was dick,anapaestic,10
133454,that we wish'd him full ten times a day at old nick,anapaestic,10
133455,but missing his mirth and agreeable vein,anapaestic,10
133456,as often we wish'd to have dick back again,anapaestic,10
133457,here cumberland lies having acted his parts,anapaestic,10
133458,the terence of england the mender of hearts,anapaestic,10
133459,a flattering painter who made it his care,anapaestic,10

133461,his gallants are all faultless his women divine,anapaestic,10
133462,and comedy wonders at being so fine,anapaestic,10
133463,like a tragedy queen he has dizen'd her out,anapaestic,10
133464,or rather like tragedy giving a rout,anapaestic,10
133465,his fools have their follies so lost in a crowd,anapaestic,10
133466,of virtues and feelings that folly grows proud,anapaestic,10
133467,and coxcombs alike in their failings alone,anapaestic,10
133468,adopting his portraits are pleas'd with their own,anapaestic,10
133469,say where has our poet this malady caught,anapaestic,10
133470,or wherefore his characters thus without fault,anapaestic,10
133471,say was it that vainly directing his view,anapaestic,10
133472,to find out mens virtues and finding them few,anapaestic,10
133473,quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf,anapaestic,10
133474,he grew lazy at last and drew from himself,anapaestic,10
133475,here douglas retires from his toils to relax,anapaestic,10
133476,the scourge of impostors the terror of quacks,anapaestic,10
133477,come all ye quack bards and ye quacking divines,anapaestic,10

133480,i fear'd for your safety i fear'd for my own,anapaestic,10

133486,no countryman living their tricks to discover,anapaestic,10
133487,detection her taper shall quench to a spark,anapaestic,10
133488,and scotchman meet scotchman and cheat in the dark,anapaestic,10
133489,here lies david garrick describe me who can,anapaestic,10
133490,an abridgment of all that was pleasant in man,anapaestic,10
133491,as an actor confest without rival to shine,anapaestic,10
133492,as a wit if not first in the very first line,anapaestic,10
133493,yet with talents like these and an excellent heart,anapaestic,10
133494,the man had his failings a dupe to his art,anapaestic,10
133495,like an illjudging beauty his colours he spread,anapaestic,10
133496,and beplaister'd with rouge his own natural red,anapaestic,10
133497,on the stage he was natural simple affecting,anapaestic,10
133498,'twas only that when he was off he was acting,anapaestic,10
133499,with no reason on earth to go out of his way,anapaestic,10
133500,he turn'd and he varied full ten times aday,anapaestic,10
133501,tho' secure of our hearts yet confoundedly sick,anapaestic,10
133502,if they were not his own by finessing and trick,anapaestic,10
133503,he cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack,anapaestic,10
133504,for he knew when he pleas'd he could whistle them back,anapaestic,10
133505,of praise a mere glutton he swallow'd what came,anapaestic,10
133506,and the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame,anapaestic,10
133507,'till his relish grown callous almost to disease,anapaestic,10
133508,who pepper'd the highest was surest to please,anapaestic,10
133509,but let us be candid and speak out our mind,anapaestic,10
133510,if dunces applauded he paid them in kind,anapaestic,10
133511,ye kenricks ye kellys and woodfalls so grave,anapaestic,10
133512,what a commerce was yours while you got and you gave,anapaestic,10

133514,while he was beroscius'd and you were beprais'd,anapaestic,10
133515,but peace to his spirit wherever it flies,anapaestic,10
133516,to act as an angel and mix with the skies,anapaestic,10
133517,those poets who owe their best fame to his skill,anapaestic,10
133518,shall still be his flatterers go where he will,anapaestic,10
133519,old shakespeare receive him with praise and with love,anapaestic,10
133520,and beaumonts and bens be his kellys above,anapaestic,10
133521,here hickey reclines a most blunt pleasant creature,anapaestic,10
133522,and slander itself must allow him goodnature,anapaestic,10
133523,he cherish'd his friend and he relish'd a bumper,anapaestic,10
133524,yet one fault he had and that one was a thumper,anapaestic,10
133525,perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser,anapaestic,10
133526,i answer no no for he always was wiser,anapaestic,10
133527,too courteous perhaps or obligingly flat,anapaestic,10
133528,his very worst foe can't accuse him of that,anapaestic,10
133529,perhaps he confided in men as they go,anapaestic,10
133530,and so was too foolishly honest ah no,anapaestic,10
133531,then what was his failing come tell it and burn ye,anapaestic,10
133532,he was could he help it a special attorney,anapaestic,10
133533,here reynolds is laid and to tell you my mind,anapaestic,10
133534,he has not left a wiser or better behind,anapaestic,10
133535,his pencil was striking resistless and grand,anapaestic,10
133536,his manners were gentle complying and bland,anapaestic,10
133537,still born to improve us in every part,anapaestic,10
133538,his pencil our faces his manners our heart,anapaestic,10
133539,to coxcombs averse yet most civilly steering,anapaestic,10
133540,when they judg'd without skill he was still hard of hearing,anapaestic,10
133541,when they talk'd of their raphaels corregios and stuff,anapaestic,10
133542,he shifted hiso trumpet and only took snuff,anapaestic,10
134551,as damon was pensively walking one day,anapaestic,10
134552,three pretty tight lasses he met in his way,anapaestic,10
134553,and who should they be that were taking the air,anapaestic,10
134554,but nelly and molly and charlot so fair,anapaestic,10
134555,the swain who to beauty had never been blind,anapaestic,10
134556,thought this was the season to tell 'em his mind,anapaestic,10
134557,but first he debated to which lovely lass,anapaestic,10
134558,he should offer his tenders and open his case,anapaestic,10
134559,that nelly was pretty he could not deny,anapaestic,10
134560,but molly he thought had the sprightliest eye,anapaestic,10
134561,so on her his affections they rested awhile,anapaestic,10
134562,'till charlot appear'd with a look and a smile,anapaestic,10
134563,with a look and a smile which sure mischief had done,anapaestic,10
134564,had the swain been encounter'd by charlot alone,anapaestic,10
134565,perplext in his thought and disturb'd in his breast,anapaestic,10
134566,and unable to tell which bright lass he lov'd best,anapaestic,10
134567,he folded his arms to the grove he retir'd,anapaestic,10
134568,and decently on the green willow expir'd,anapaestic,10
134569,for three at a time what poor mortal could bear,anapaestic,10
134570,one alone trust me charlot had made him rejoice,anapaestic,10
134571,and the swain been quite happy with what,anapaestic,10

138702,i feel it i feel my soul loose from its chain,anapaestic,10
138703,and at last freedom comes often dream'd of in vain,anapaestic,10
138704,the flame is burn'd out and each passion at rest,anapaestic,10
138705,under which love disguis'd still might lurk in my breast,anapaestic,10
138706,no more when thou'rt nam'd the warm blushes arise,anapaestic,10
138707,no more slutters my heart when i meet with your eyes,anapaestic,10
138708,in my sleep now no longer thy image i see,anapaestic,10
138709,nor the first of my thoughts when i wake is of thee,anapaestic,10
138710,when from thee no more of thy absence i plain,anapaestic,10
138711,when with thee i feel neither pleasure nor pain,anapaestic,10
138712,my heart without fondness can muse on thy charms,anapaestic,10
138713,my past pains i recount yet no passion alarms,anapaestic,10
138714,discompos'd i'm no longer when tow'rd me you move,anapaestic,10
138715,and at ease with my rival i talk of my love,anapaestic,10
138716,whether haughty thy frown whether gentle thy strain,anapaestic,10
138717,in vain thy proud looks thy fond speeches in vain,anapaestic,10
138718,thy false tongue to beguile me no more has the art,anapaestic,10
138719,no more thy keen eye knows the way to my heart,anapaestic,10
138720,whether pensive or cheerful no longer to you,anapaestic,10
138721,for this are my thanks or for that my blame due,anapaestic,10
138722,the gay prospect now pleases though you are away,anapaestic,10
138723,and your presence no more can make dreariness gay,anapaestic,10
138724,believe me i still can allow that thou'rt fair,anapaestic,10
138725,but not that no fairone can with thee compare,anapaestic,10
138726,and though beauteous i own thee yet still in thy face,anapaestic,10
138727,i can now spy a fault which i once thought a grace,anapaestic,10
138728,when first the fix'd arrow i pluck'd from my heart,anapaestic,10
138729,oh methought i shou'd die so severe was the smart,anapaestic,10
138730,but from pow'r so oppressive to set myself clear,anapaestic,10
138731,torments greater than dying with patience i'd bear,anapaestic,10
138732,when lim'd the poor bird thus with eagerness strains,anapaestic,10
138733,nor regrets the lost plume so his freedom he gains,anapaestic,10
138734,the loss of his plumage small time will restore,anapaestic,10
138735,and once try'd the false twig it can cheat him no more,anapaestic,10
138736,the old flame never flatter yourself to believe,anapaestic,10
138737,while it dwells on my tongue in my heart still must live,anapaestic,10
138738,our dangers when past with delight we repeat,anapaestic,10
138739,what in suffering was pain to remembrance is sweet,anapaestic,10
138740,'tis thus when the soldier returns from the wars,anapaestic,10
138741,he fights o'er his old battles and vaunts of his scars,anapaestic,10
138742,with pleasure the captive his liberty gain'd,anapaestic,10
138743,the fetters thus shows which once held him enchain'd,anapaestic,10
138744,thus i talk and i still will talk on while i may,anapaestic,10
138745,nor heed i though you disbelieve what i say,anapaestic,10
138746,i ask not that phoebe my talk should approve,anapaestic,10
138747,let her too if she can talk at ease of my love,anapaestic,10
138748,an inconstant i leave a true lover you lose,anapaestic,10
138749,which first of us two will have comfort who knows,anapaestic,10
138750,this i know phoebe ne'er such a true love will find,anapaestic,10
138751,i can easily meet with a fair as unkind,anapaestic,10
139438,good madam when ladies are willing,anapaestic,10
139439,a man must needs look like a fool,anapaestic,10
139440,for me i wou'd not give a shilling,anapaestic,10
139441,for one that is kind out of rule,anapaestic,10
139442,at least you might stay for my offer,anapaestic,10
139443,not snatch like old maids in despair,anapaestic,10
139444,if you've liv'd to these years without proffer,anapaestic,10
139445,your sighs are now lost in the air,anapaestic,10
139446,you might leave me to guess by your blushing,anapaestic,10
139447,and not speak the matter so plain,anapaestic,10
139448,'tis ours to pursue and be pushing,anapaestic,10
139449,'tis yours to affect a disdain,anapaestic,10
139450,that you're in a pitiful taking,anapaestic,10
139451,by all your sweet ogles i see,anapaestic,10
139452,but the fruit that will fall without shaking,anapaestic,10
139453,indeed is too mellow for me,anapaestic,10
139984,too poor for a bribe and too proud to importune,anapaestic,10
139985,he had not the method of making a fortune,anapaestic,10
139986,could love and could hate so was thought somewhat odd,anapaestic,10
139987,no very great wit he believed in a god,anapaestic,10
139988,a post or a pension he did not desire,anapaestic,10
139989,but left church and state to charles townshend and squire,anapaestic,10
140829,sweet companion of the muse,trochaic,8
140830,gentle solitude appear,trochaic,8
140831,all thy calm content infuse,trochaic,8
140832,soften anguish banish care,trochaic,8
140833,lead me o majestic queen,trochaic,8
140834,thro' the aromatic scene,trochaic,8
140835,nature's copied here by art,trochaic,8
140836,joyful we the fraud confess,trochaic,8
140837,yet so well performs her part,trochaic,8
140838,'tis but nature's better dress,trochaic,8
140839,solitude here fix my seat,trochaic,8
140840,here in cowley's soft retreat,trochaic,8
140841,lay me in the silent mead,trochaic,8
140842,where the murmuring river flows,trochaic,8
140843,where the elm expands the shade,trochaic,8
140844,and each rising beauty blows,trochaic,8
140845,there i'll say in peace of mind,trochaic,8
140846,empty greatness fall behind,trochaic,8
140847,teach thy votary all the powers,trochaic,8
140848,of each plant and every tree,trochaic,8
140849,tell how shortliv'd are the flowers,trochaic,8
140850,bring the moral home to me,trochaic,8
140851,bid me fleeting life despise,trochaic,8
140852,make me humble make me wise,trochaic,8
140853,pride within my lowly cell,trochaic,8
140854,never yet uprear'd her head,trochaic,8
140855,solitude with thee i'll dwell,trochaic,8
140856,pride with me is long since dead,trochaic,8
140857,cold to pleasure deaf to praise,trochaic,8
140858,here i wish to end my days,trochaic,8
140970,how fondly i gaze on the fast fallingleaves,anapaestic,10
140971,that mark as i wander the summer's decline,anapaestic,10
140972,and then i exclaim while my conscious heart heaves,anapaestic,10
140973,thus early to droop and to perish be mine,anapaestic,10
140974,yet once i remember in moments long past,anapaestic,10
140975,most dear to my sight was the spring's opening bloom,anapaestic,10
140976,but then my youth's spring sorrow had not o'ercast,anapaestic,10
140977,nor taught me with fondness to look on the tomb,anapaestic,10
140978,fair spring now no longer these grieffaded eyes,anapaestic,10
140979,thy rich glowing beauties with pleasure can see,anapaestic,10
140980,thy pale sickly hues chilly autumn i prize,anapaestic,10
140981,they suit blighted hopes and are emblems of me,anapaestic,10
140982,where dost thou bide blessed soul of my love,anapaestic,10
140983,is ether thy dwelling o whisper me where,anapaestic,10
140984,rapt in remembrance while lonely i rove,anapaestic,10
140985,i gaze on bright clouds and i fancy thee there,anapaestic,10
140986,or to thy bower when musing i go,anapaestic,10
140987,i think 't is thy voice that i hear in the breeze,anapaestic,10
140988,softly it seems to speak peace to my woe,anapaestic,10
140989,and life once again for a moment can please,anapaestic,10
140990,if this be phrensy alone 't is so dear,anapaestic,10
140991,that long may the pleasing delusion be nigh,anapaestic,10
140992,still ellen's voice in the breeze may i hear,anapaestic,10
140993,still see in bright clouds the kind beams of her eye,anapaestic,10
140994,low hung the dark clouds on plinlimmon's tall peak,anapaestic,10
140995,and slowly yet surely the winter drew near,anapaestic,10
140996,when ellen sweet ellen a tear on her cheek,anapaestic,10
140997,exclaimed as we parted in may i'll be here,anapaestic,10
140998,how swiftly i ran up the mountain's steep height,anapaestic,10
140999,to catch the last glimpse of an object so dear,anapaestic,10
141000,and when i no longer could keep her in sight,anapaestic,10
141001,i thought on her promise in may i'll be here,anapaestic,10
141002,now gladly i mark from plinlimmon's tall peak,anapaestic,10
141003,the lowhanging vapours and clouds disappear,anapaestic,10
141004,and climb the rough mountain thence ellen to seek,anapaestic,10
141005,repeating her promise in may i'll be here,anapaestic,10
141006,but vainly i gaze the wide prospect around,anapaestic,10
141007,'t is may yet no ellen returning is near,anapaestic,10
141008,oh when shall i see her when feel my heart bound,anapaestic,10
141009,as sweetly she cries it is may and i'm here,anapaestic,10
141010,you ask why these mountains delight me no more,anapaestic,10
141011,and why lovely clwyd's attractions are o'er,anapaestic,10
141012,ah have you not heard then the cause of my pain,anapaestic,10
141013,the pride of fair clwyd the boast of the plain,anapaestic,10
141014,we never no never shall gaze on again,anapaestic,10
141015,what though from her coldness keen anguish i felt,anapaestic,10
141016,and vainly to move her in agony knelt,anapaestic,10
141017,yet could i restore her i'd never complain,anapaestic,10
141018,not e'en though she doomed me to endless disdain,anapaestic,10
141019,i'd bear any torture to see her again,anapaestic,10
141020,i grieved when on others with kindness she gazed,anapaestic,10
141021,i mourned when another with pleasure she praised,anapaestic,10
141022,but could i recall her to life by my pain,anapaestic,10
141023,i'd urge her to favour some happier swain,anapaestic,10
141024,and wish no reward but to see her again,anapaestic,10
141025,those beauties that charmed me from death i would free,anapaestic,10
141026,though sure that those beauties another's should be,anapaestic,10
141027,but truth and affection and grief are all vain,anapaestic,10
141028,the pride of fair clwyd the boast of our plain,anapaestic,10
141029,we never ah never can gaze on again,anapaestic,10
141030,in a vale fring'd with woodland where grottos abound,anapaestic,10
141031,and rivulets murmur and echoes resound,anapaestic,10
141032,i vow'd to the muses my time and my care,anapaestic,10
141033,since neither could win me the smiles of my fair,anapaestic,10
141034,as freedom inspir'd me i rang'd and i sung,anapaestic,10
141035,and daphne's dear name never fell from my tongue,anapaestic,10
141036,and if once a smooth accent delighted my ear,anapaestic,10
141037,i should wish unawares that my daphne might hear,anapaestic,10
141038,with fairest ideas my bosom i stor'd,anapaestic,10
141039,allusions to none but the nymph i ador'd,anapaestic,10
141040,and the more i with study my fancy refin'd,anapaestic,10
141041,the deeper impressions she made on my mind,anapaestic,10
141042,ah whilst i the beauties of nature pursue,anapaestic,10
141043,i still must my daphne's fair image renew,anapaestic,10
141044,the graces have chosen with daphne to rove,anapaestic,10
141045,and the muses are all in alliance with love,anapaestic,10
141106,yes these are the scenes where with iris i stray'd,anapaestic,10
141107,but short was her sway for so lovely a maid,anapaestic,10
141108,in the bloom of her youth to a cloister she run,anapaestic,10
141109,in the bloom of her graces too fair for a nun,anapaestic,10
141110,illgrounded no doubt a devotion must prove,anapaestic,10
141111,so fatal to beauty so killing to love,anapaestic,10
141112,yes these are the meadows the shrubs and the plains,anapaestic,10
141113,once the scene of my pleasures the scene of my pains,anapaestic,10
141114,how many soft moments i spent in this grove,anapaestic,10
141115,how fair was my nymph and how fervent my love,anapaestic,10
141116,be still tho' my heart thine emotion give o'er,anapaestic,10
141117,remember the season of love is no more,anapaestic,10
141118,with her how i stray'd amid fountains and bow'rs,anapaestic,10
141119,or loiter'd behind and collected the flow'rs,anapaestic,10
141120,then breathless with ardor my fairone pursu'd,anapaestic,10
141121,and to think with what kindness my garland she view'd,anapaestic,10
141122,but be still my fond heart this emotion give o'er,anapaestic,10
141123,fain wouldst thou forget thou must love her no more,anapaestic,10
141242,ye belles and ye flirts and ye pert little things,anapaestic,10
141243,who trip in this frolicksome round,anapaestic,10
141244,pray tell me from whence this indecency springs,anapaestic,10
141245,the sexes at once to confound,anapaestic,10
141246,what means the cock'd hat and the masculine air,anapaestic,10
141247,with each motion design'd to perplex,anapaestic,10
141248,bright eyes were intended to languish not stare,anapaestic,10
141249,and softness the test of your sex,anapaestic,10
141250,the girl who on beauty depends for support,anapaestic,10
141251,may call ev'ry art to her aid,anapaestic,10
141252,the bosom display'd and the petticoat short,anapaestic,10
141253,are samples she gives of her trade,anapaestic,10
141254,but you on whom fortune indulgently smiles,anapaestic,10
141255,and whom pride has preserv'd from the snare,anapaestic,10
141256,should slily attack us with coyness and wiles,anapaestic,10
141257,not with open and insolent air,anapaestic,10
141258,the venus whose statue delights all mankind,anapaestic,10
141259,shrinks modestly back from the view,anapaestic,10
141260,and kindly shou'd seem by the artist design'd,anapaestic,10
141261,to serve as a model for you,anapaestic,10
141262,then learn with her beauties to copy her air,anapaestic,10
141263,nor venture too much to reveal,anapaestic,10
141264,our fancies will paint what you cover with care,anapaestic,10
141265,and double each charm you conceal,anapaestic,10
141266,the blushes of morn and the mildness of may,anapaestic,10
141267,are charms which no art can procure,anapaestic,10
141268,oh be but yourselves and our homage we pay,anapaestic,10
141269,and your empire is solid and sure,anapaestic,10
141270,but if amazon like you attack your gallants,anapaestic,10
141271,and put us in fear of our lives,anapaestic,10
141272,you may do very well for sisters and aunts,anapaestic,10
141273,but believe me you'll never be wives,anapaestic,10
141302,'midst beauty and pleasure's gay triumphs to languish,anapaestic,10
141303,and droop without knowing the source of my anguish,anapaestic,10
141304,to start from short slumbers and look for the morning,anapaestic,10
141305,yet close my dull eyes when i see it returning,anapaestic,10
141306,sighs sudden and frequent looks ever dejected,anapaestic,10
141307,sounds that steal from my tongue by no meaning connected,anapaestic,10

142074,his fears for my peace by my song i'll beguile,anapaestic,10
142075,nor venture to gaze on his eyes but by stealth,anapaestic,10
142076,for conscious i am by my glance is exprest,anapaestic,10
142077,the passion that faithful as hopeless will be,anapaestic,10
142078,and he whom alas i can ne'er render blest,anapaestic,10
142079,shall never no never know sorrow through me,anapaestic,10
142196,to wander alone when the moon faintly beaming,anapaestic,10
142197,where owls seek for covert and night birds complaining,anapaestic,10
142198,'tis not for the happy come daughter of sorrow,anapaestic,10

142237,and all the gay delights are fled,trochaic,8
142343,grief and mis'ry hence away,trochaic,8

142451,how easy was colin how blithe and how gay,anapaestic,10
142452,ere he met the fair chloris how sprightly his lay,anapaestic,10
142453,so graceful her form so accomplish'd her mind,anapaestic,10
142454,sure pity he thought with such charms must be join'd,anapaestic,10
142455,whenever she danc'd or whenever she sung,anapaestic,10
142456,how just was her motion how sweet was her tongue,anapaestic,10
142457,and when the youth told her his passionate flame,anapaestic,10
142458,she allow'd him to fancy her heart felt the same,anapaestic,10
142459,with ardour he press'd her to think him sincere,anapaestic,10
142460,but alas she redoubled each hope and each fear,anapaestic,10
142461,she would not deny nor she would not approve,anapaestic,10
142462,and she neither refus'd him nor gave him her love,anapaestic,10
142463,now cheer'd by complacence now froze by disdain,anapaestic,10
142464,he languish'd for freedom but languish'd in vain,anapaestic,10
142465,'till thyrsis who pity'd so helpless a slave,anapaestic,10
142466,eas'd his heart of its pain by the counsel he gave,anapaestic,10
142467,forsake her said he and reject her awhile,anapaestic,10
142468,if she love you she soon will return with a smile,anapaestic,10
142469,you can judge of her passion by absence alone,anapaestic,10
142470,and by absence will conquer her heart or your own,anapaestic,10
142471,this advice he pursu'd but the remedy prov'd,anapaestic,10
142472,too fatal alas to the fair one he lov'd,anapaestic,10
142473,which cur'd his own passion but left her in vain,anapaestic,10

142633,when the nymphs were contending for beauty and fame,anapaestic,10
142634,fair sylvia stood foremost in right of her claim,anapaestic,10
142635,when to crown the high transports dear conquest excites,anapaestic,10
142636,at court she was envy'd and toasted at white's,anapaestic,10
142637,but how shall i whisper this fair one's sad case,anapaestic,10
142638,a cruel disease has spoil'd her sweet face,anapaestic,10
142639,her vermillion is chang'd to a dull settled red,anapaestic,10
142640,and all the gay graces of beauty are fled,anapaestic,10
142641,yet take heed all ye fair how you triumph in vain,anapaestic,10
142642,for sylvia tho' alter'd from pretty to plain,anapaestic,10
142643,is now more engaging fince reason took place,anapaestic,10
142644,than when she possess'd the perfections of face,anapaestic,10
142645,convinc'd she no more can coquet it and teaze,anapaestic,10
142646,instead of tormenting she studies to please,anapaestic,10
142647,makes truth and discretion the guide of her life,anapaestic,10
142648,and tho' spoil'd for a toast she's well form'd for a wife,anapaestic,10
142709,he's gone the bright way that his honour directs him,anapaestic,10
142710,oh all ye kind powers let me beg you protect him,anapaestic,10
142711,he's gone my dear and left me here mourning,anapaestic,10
142712,but hang these dull thoughts i'le fancy him returning,anapaestic,10
142713,returning i'le think the great hero victorious,anapaestic,10
142714,with joy to my arms as faithful as glorious,anapaestic,10
142715,against his bright eyes i am sure there's no standing,anapaestic,10
142716,he looks like a god and moves as commanding,anapaestic,10
142717,with a face so angelick the foe will be charmed,anapaestic,10
142718,the conquest were his tho he met'em disarm'd,anapaestic,10
142719,they could not be sure of a rational nature,anapaestic,10
142720,that wou'd not relent at so moving a feature,anapaestic,10
142721,venus disguis'd he'el be thought by his beauty,anapaestic,10
142722,and spar'd from the sense of a generous duty,anapaestic,10
142723,yet when i reflect on the wounded and dying,anapaestic,10
142724,in spight of my courage it sets me a sighing,anapaestic,10
142725,but the resolute brave no danger can stay him,anapaestic,10
142726,tho' i us'd all my charms and arts to delay him,anapaestic,10
142727,yet oh ye kind powers you are bound to protect him,anapaestic,10
142728,since he'es gone the bright way that glory directs him,anapaestic,10
142729,ye scenes that engag'd my gay youth,anapaestic,10
142730,say whither so fast do ye fly,anapaestic,10
142731,if the lesson you told me was truth,anapaestic,10
142732,ah why do ye fade from my eye,anapaestic,10
142733,that meadow where often i stray'd,anapaestic,10
142734,that bank and yon shadowy tree,anapaestic,10
142735,those streams with such fondness survey'd,anapaestic,10
142736,have hid all their sweetness from me,anapaestic,10
142737,yon hill that uprears his smooth head,anapaestic,10
142738,where the wildthyme its fragrance bestows,anapaestic,10
142739,whose verdures have rose from my bed,anapaestic,10
142740,and whose breezes have sigh'd my repose,anapaestic,10
142741,what tho' from his summit so high,anapaestic,10
142742,flock cottage and woodland are seen,anapaestic,10
142743,yet no more i with fondness descry,anapaestic,10
142744,for indifference rises between,anapaestic,10
142745,ah whither ye sweets do ye fly,anapaestic,10
142746,for fancy your absence must mourn,anapaestic,10
142747,ah say will ye fade from my eye,anapaestic,10
142748,and yet will ye never return,anapaestic,10
142749,that valley whose mantle so gay,anapaestic,10
142750,is with primrose and cowslip o'erspread,anapaestic,10
142751,no longer invites me to stray,anapaestic,10
142752,and rifle the sweets of their bed,anapaestic,10
142753,not odious at present they look,anapaestic,10
142754,i discern that their colours are bright,anapaestic,10
142755,but their charms have my fancy forsook,anapaestic,10
142756,and their fragrance forgot to delight,anapaestic,10
142757,to my cooler attention how dear,anapaestic,10
142758,the soothing complaint of the dove,anapaestic,10
142759,i have left my companions to hear,anapaestic,10
142760,the woodlinnet warble her love,anapaestic,10
142761,nor these can my footsteps retard,anapaestic,10
142762,or if round me they carelessly fly,anapaestic,10
142763,from mine eyes they attract no regard,anapaestic,10
142764,and my ears their soft warblings deny,anapaestic,10
142765,ah sure 'tis the bus'ness of life,anapaestic,10
142766,that bids those endearments depart,anapaestic,10
142767,to involve us in cares and in strife,anapaestic,10
142768,that estrange and entangle the heart,anapaestic,10
142769,with destiny all must comply,anapaestic,10
142770,yet cannot my fancy but mourn,anapaestic,10
142771,for the season that fades from my eye,anapaestic,10
142772,and the sweets that must never return,anapaestic,10
142805,now evening had tinged the gay landskip with gold,anapaestic,10
142806,the swains were retired and their flocks in the fold,anapaestic,10
142807,when delia complain'd in the woodland alone,anapaestic,10
142808,loud ecchoes retain'd and replied to her moan,anapaestic,10
142809,the warblers sat listening around on the spray,anapaestic,10
142810,and the gale stole in murmurs as soft as her lay,anapaestic,10
142811,ah my strephon twas thus the fair mourner begun,anapaestic,10
142812,how cruel to leave me thus lost and undone,anapaestic,10
142813,your vows like the wind you forget or despise,anapaestic,10
142814,you slight my complaints and are deaf to my cries,anapaestic,10
142815,the frown once so dreadful ah where is its power,anapaestic,10
142816,the voice heard with transport gives transport no more,anapaestic,10
142817,though the sylvans to please me exert all their powers,anapaestic,10
142818,though the swains crown my head with a garland of flowers,anapaestic,10
142819,though they swear that my eyes like the morning are gay,anapaestic,10
142820,that my song is more sweet than the nightingales lay,anapaestic,10
142821,yet while strephon is absent dejected dismay'd,anapaestic,10
142822,i droop like a flower that repines in the shade,anapaestic,10
142823,o return gentle shepherd return to my prayer,anapaestic,10
142824,ah think how i sigh in unpitied despair,anapaestic,10
142825,but in vain all my hopes all my wishes are vain,anapaestic,10
142826,while the streams and the breezes thus hear me complain,anapaestic,10
142827,while the birds to my anguish reply from the bough,anapaestic,10
142828,he flies from my arms and regards not my woe,anapaestic,10
142829,ah too easy to trust all the oaths that he swore,anapaestic,10
142830,when he vow'd that no nymph had e'er charm'd him before,anapaestic,10
142831,be warn'd then ye fair nor too rashly believe,anapaestic,10
142832,think the men when they flatter but want to deceive,anapaestic,10
142833,that the fond easy promise was ne'er meant to bind,anapaestic,10
142834,and believe when they swear that their oaths are all wind,anapaestic,10
142843,shall pope sing his flames,anapaestic,10
142844,with quality dames,anapaestic,10
142845,and dutchesses toast when he dines,anapaestic,10
142846,shall swift ballads compose,anapaestic,10
142847,on the girls at the rose,anapaestic,10
142848,whilst unsung is my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142849,o were phoebus my friend,anapaestic,10
142850,or would bacchus but lend,anapaestic,10
142851,me the spirits that flow from his wines,anapaestic,10
142852,the lass of the mill,anapaestic,10
142853,molly mogg and lepell,anapaestic,10
142854,shou'd be dowdies to fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142855,the astronomer cries,anapaestic,10
142856,look up to yon skies,anapaestic,10
142857,and view the bright heavenly signs,anapaestic,10
142858,for a sight brighter far,anapaestic,10
142859,than sun moon or star,anapaestic,10
142860,let him look at my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142861,the miser for gain,anapaestic,10
142862,thinks nothing of pain,anapaestic,10
142863,and contentedly digs in the mines,anapaestic,10
142864,let him take all peru,anapaestic,10
142865,and rich mexico too,anapaestic,10
142866,what are these to my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142867,any porter may serve,anapaestic,10
142868,for a copy to carve,anapaestic,10
142869,an alcides with muscular chines,anapaestic,10
142870,but a venus to draw,anapaestic,10
142871,bright as eye ever saw,anapaestic,10
142872,he must copy my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142873,the favourite child,anapaestic,10
142874,whom her fondness has spoil'd,anapaestic,10
142875,for mamma often whimpers and whines,anapaestic,10
142876,and this hour let me die,anapaestic,10
142877,but i languish and sigh,anapaestic,10
142878,when i'm absent from fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142879,for quadrille when the fair,anapaestic,10
142880,cards and counters prepare,anapaestic,10
142881,they cast out the tens eights and nines,anapaestic,10
142882,and in love 'tis my fear,anapaestic,10
142883,the like fate i shall share,anapaestic,10
142884,discarded by fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142885,astrologers prove,anapaestic,10
142886,the conjunctions above,anapaestic,10
142887,with their houses squares circles and signs,anapaestic,10
142888,but oh could they show,anapaestic,10
142889,one conjunction below,anapaestic,10
142890,between me and my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142891,with hearts full of rapture,anapaestic,10
142892,our good dean and chapter,anapaestic,10
142893,count over and finger their fines,anapaestic,10
142894,but i'd give their estate,anapaestic,10
142895,was it ten times as great,anapaestic,10
142896,for one kiss from my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142897,in the midst of gay sights,anapaestic,10
142898,and foreign delights,anapaestic,10
142899,for his country the banish'd man pines,anapaestic,10
142900,thus from her when away,anapaestic,10
142901,tho' my eyes they may stray,anapaestic,10
142902,yet my heart is with fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142903,antiquity's page,anapaestic,10
142904,the rev'rend sage,anapaestic,10
142905,explains from old medals and coins,anapaestic,10
142906,but no comment so fit,anapaestic,10
142907,on youth beauty and wit,anapaestic,10
142908,can they find as my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142909,it is atropos' sport,anapaestic,10
142910,with her sheers to cut short,anapaestic,10
142911,the thread which dame lachesis twines,anapaestic,10
142912,but forbear you curst jade,anapaestic,10
142913,or cut mine not the thread,anapaestic,10
142914,that was spun for my fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142915,the young pair for a crown,anapaestic,10
142916,on his book paid him down,anapaestic,10
142917,the sacrist obsequiously joins,anapaestic,10
142918,was i bishop i swear,anapaestic,10
142919,i'd resign him my chair,anapaestic,10
142920,to unite me with fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142921,for my first night i'd go,anapaestic,10
142922,to those regions of snow,anapaestic,10
142923,where the sun for six months never shines,anapaestic,10
142924,and oh there shou'd complain,anapaestic,10
142925,he too soon came again,anapaestic,10
142926,to disturb me with fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142927,the pastures the sheep,anapaestic,10
142928,shall exchange for the deep,anapaestic,10
142929,and mackrel shall grow on the vines,anapaestic,10
142930,the sun shall burn blue,anapaestic,10
142931,ere my heart proves untrue,anapaestic,10
142932,or forgets to love fair charlotte lynes,anapaestic,10
142987,how pleasant is love,anapaestic,10
142988,when forbid or unknown,anapaestic,10
142989,was my passion approv'd,anapaestic,10
142990,it would quickly be gone,anapaestic,10
142991,it adds to the charms,anapaestic,10
142992,when we steal the delight,anapaestic,10
142993,why should love be expos'd,anapaestic,10
142994,since himself has no sight,anapaestic,10
142995,in some silvan shade,anapaestic,10
142996,let me sigh for my swain,anapaestic,10
142997,where none but an eccho,anapaestic,10
142998,will speak on't again,anapaestic,10
142999,thus silent and soft,anapaestic,10
143000,i'll pass the time on,anapaestic,10
143001,and when i grow weary,anapaestic,10
143002,i'll make my love known,anapaestic,10
145565,when approach'd by the fair dewy fingers of spring,anapaestic,10
145566,swelling buds open first and look gay,anapaestic,10
145567,when the birds on the boughs by their mates sit and sing,anapaestic,10
145568,and are danc'd by the breeze on each spray,anapaestic,10
145569,when gently descending the rain in soft showers,anapaestic,10
145570,with its moisture refreshes the ground,anapaestic,10
145571,and the drops as they hang on the plants and the flowers,anapaestic,10
145572,like rich gems beam a lustre around,anapaestic,10
145573,when the woodpigeons sit on the branches and cooe,anapaestic,10
145574,and the cuckow proclaims with his voice,anapaestic,10
145575,that nature marks this for the season to wooe,anapaestic,10
145576,and for all that can love to rejoice,anapaestic,10
145577,in a cottage at night may i spend all my time,anapaestic,10
145578,in the fields and the meadows all day,anapaestic,10
145579,with a maiden whose charms are as yet in their prime,anapaestic,10
145580,young as april and blooming as may,anapaestic,10
145581,when the lark with shrill notes sings aloft in the morn,anapaestic,10
145582,may my fairest and i sweetly wake,anapaestic,10
145583,view the far distant hills which the sun beams adorn,anapaestic,10
145584,then arise and our cottage forsake,anapaestic,10
145585,when the sun shines so warm that my charmer and i,anapaestic,10
145586,may recline on the turf without fear,anapaestic,10
145587,let us there all vain thoughts and ambition defy,anapaestic,10
145588,while we breathe the first sweets of the year,anapaestic,10
145589,be this spot on a hill and a spring from its side,anapaestic,10
145590,bubble out and transparently flow,anapaestic,10
145591,creep gently along in meanders and glide,anapaestic,10
145592,thro' the vale strow'd with daisies below,anapaestic,10
145593,while the bee flies from blossom to blossom and sips,anapaestic,10
145594,and the violets their sweetness impart,anapaestic,10
145595,let me hang on her neck and so taste from her lips,anapaestic,10
145596,the rich cordial that thrills to the heart,anapaestic,10
145597,while the dove sits lamenting the loss of its mate,anapaestic,10
145598,which the fowler has caught in his snares,anapaestic,10
145599,may we think ourselves blest that it is not our fate,anapaestic,10
145600,to endure such an absence as theirs,anapaestic,10
145601,may i listen to all her soft tender sweet notes,anapaestic,10
145602,when she sings and no sounds interfere,anapaestic,10
145603,but the warbling of birds which in stretching their throats,anapaestic,10
145604,are at strife to be louder than her,anapaestic,10
145605,when the daisies and cowslips and primroses blow,anapaestic,10
145606,and checquer the meads and the lawns,anapaestic,10
145607,may we see bounding there the swift lightfooted doe,anapaestic,10
145608,and pursue with our eye the young fawns,anapaestic,10
145609,when the lapwings just fledg'd o'er the turf take their run,anapaestic,10
145610,and the sirstlings are all at their play,anapaestic,10
145611,and the harmless young lambs skip about in the sun,anapaestic,10
145612,let us then be as frolic as they,anapaestic,10
145613,when i talk of my love should i chance to espy,anapaestic,10
145614,that she seems to mistrust what i say,anapaestic,10
145615,by a tear that is ready to fall from her eye,anapaestic,10
145616,with my lips let me wipe it away,anapaestic,10
145617,if we sit or we walk may i cast round my eyes,anapaestic,10
145618,and let no single beauty escape,anapaestic,10
145619,but see none to create so much love and surprize,anapaestic,10
145620,as her eyes and her face and her shape,anapaestic,10
145621,thus each day let us pass till the buds turn to leaves,anapaestic,10
145622,and the meadows around us are mown,anapaestic,10
145623,when the lass on the sweetsmelling haycock receives,anapaestic,10
145624,what she afterwards blushes to own,anapaestic,10
145625,when evenings grow cool and the flowers hang their heads,anapaestic,10
145626,with the dew then no longer we'll roam,anapaestic,10
145627,with my arm round her waist in a path thro' the meads,anapaestic,10
145628,let us hasten to find our way home,anapaestic,10
145629,when the birds are at roost with their heads in their wings,anapaestic,10
145630,each one by the side of its mate,anapaestic,10
145631,when a mist that arises a drowsiness brings,anapaestic,10
145632,upon all but the owl and the bat,anapaestic,10
145633,when soft rest is requir'd and the stars lend their light,anapaestic,10
145634,and all nature lies quiet and still,anapaestic,10
145635,when no sound breaks the sacred repose of the night,anapaestic,10
145636,but at distance the clack of a mill,anapaestic,10
145637,with peace for our pillow and free from all noise,anapaestic,10
145638,so that voices in whispers are known,anapaestic,10
145639,let us give and receive all the nameless soft joys,anapaestic,10
145640,that are mus'd on by lovers alone,anapaestic,10
146591,fairy minstrels haste away,trochaic,8
146592,here attune the pensive lay,trochaic,8
146593,where these roses crown the sod,trochaic,8
146594,avonia's bard awaits his god,trochaic,8
146595,though avon's stream for ever flow,trochaic,8
146596,so sweet a bard it ne'er shall know,trochaic,8
146597,child of nature void of art,trochaic,8
146598,how he knew the human heart,trochaic,8
146599,when the magic shell he strung,trochaic,8
146600,echo glad responsive sung,trochaic,8
146601,whilst the cowslip's fairy train,trochaic,8
146602,lightly trod the daisy'd plain,trochaic,8
146603,and still at fall of dewy night,trochaic,8
146604,by the moon's uncertain light,trochaic,8
146605,whilst they move to airs divine,trochaic,8
146606,round his tomb they sweetly twine,trochaic,8
148710,where the light cannot pierce in a grove of all trees,anapaestic,10
148711,with my fair one as blooming as may,anapaestic,10
148712,undisturb'd by all sound but the sighs of the breeze,anapaestic,10
148713,let me pass the hot noon of the day,anapaestic,10
148714,when the sun less intense to the westward inclines,anapaestic,10
148715,for the meadows the groves we'll forsake,anapaestic,10
148716,and see the rays dance as inverted he shines,anapaestic,10
148717,on the face of some river or lake,anapaestic,10
148718,where my fairest and i on its verge as we pass,anapaestic,10
148719,for 'tis she that must still be my theme,anapaestic,10
148720,our two shadows may view on the watery glass,anapaestic,10
148721,while the fish are at play in the stream,anapaestic,10
148722,may the herds cease to lowe and the lambkins to bleat,anapaestic,10
148723,when she sings me some amorous strain,anapaestic,10
148724,all be silent and husht unless echo repeat,anapaestic,10
148725,the kind words and sweet sounds back again,anapaestic,10
148726,and when we return to our cottage at night,anapaestic,10
148727,hand in hand as we sauntering stray,anapaestic,10
148728,let the moon's silver beams thro' the leaves give us light,anapaestic,10
148729,just direct us and chequer our way,anapaestic,10
148730,let the nightingale warble its notes in our walk,anapaestic,10
148731,as thus gently and slowly we move,anapaestic,10
148732,and let no single thought be express'd in our talk,anapaestic,10
148733,but of friendship improv'd into love,anapaestic,10
148734,thus enchanted each day with these rural delights,anapaestic,10
148735,and secure from ambition's alarms,anapaestic,10
148736,soft love and repose shall divide all our nights,anapaestic,10
148737,and each morning shall rise with new charms,anapaestic,10
148876,by a prattling stream on a midsummer's eve,anapaestic,10
148877,where the woodbine and jess'mine their boughs interweave,anapaestic,10
148878,fair flora i cry'd to my arbour repair,anapaestic,10
148879,for i must have a chaplet for sweet william's hair,anapaestic,10
148880,she brought me the vi'let that grows on the hill,anapaestic,10
148881,the vale dwelling lilly and gilded jonquill,anapaestic,10
148882,but such languid odours how cou'd i approve,anapaestic,10
148883,just warm from the lips of the lad that i love,anapaestic,10
148884,she brought me his faith and his truth to display,anapaestic,10
148885,the undying myrtle and evergreen bay,anapaestic,10
148886,but why these to me who've his constancy known,anapaestic,10
148887,and billy has laurels enough of his own,anapaestic,10
148888,the next was a gift that i could not contemn,anapaestic,10
148889,for she brought me two roses that grew on a stem,anapaestic,10
148890,of the dear nuptial tie they stood emblems confest,anapaestic,10
148891,so i kiss'd 'em and press'd 'em quite close to my breast,anapaestic,10
148892,she brought me a sunflow'r this fair one's your due,anapaestic,10
148893,for it once was a maiden and lovesick like you,anapaestic,10
148894,oh give it me quick to my shepherd i'll run,anapaestic,10
148895,as true to his flame as this flow'r to the sun,anapaestic,10
149904,dame venus a daughter of jove's,anapaestic,10
149905,and amongst all his daughters most fair,anapaestic,10
149906,lost it seems t' other day the two doves,anapaestic,10
149907,that wafted her car thro' the air,anapaestic,10
149908,the dame made a heavy sad rout,anapaestic,10
149909,ran about heav'n and earth to condole 'em,anapaestic,10
149910,and sought high and low to find out,anapaestic,10
149911,where the biddyes were stray'd or who stole 'em,anapaestic,10
149912,to the god who the stragglers shou'd meet,anapaestic,10
149913,she promis'd most tempting fine pay,anapaestic,10
149914,six kisses than honey more sweet,anapaestic,10
149915,and a seventh far sweeter than they,anapaestic,10
149916,the proposal no sooner was made,anapaestic,10
149917,but it put all the gods in a flame,anapaestic,10
149918,for who would not give all he had,anapaestic,10
149919,to be kiss'd by so dainty a dame,anapaestic,10
149920,to cyprus to paphos they run,anapaestic,10
149921,where the goddess oft us'd to retire,anapaestic,10
149922,some rode round the world with the sun,anapaestic,10
149923,and search'd every country and shire,anapaestic,10
149924,but with all their hard running and riding,anapaestic,10
149925,not a god of 'em claim'd the reward,anapaestic,10
149926,for no one could tell tale or tiding,anapaestic,10
149927,if the doves were alive or were starv'd,anapaestic,10
149928,at last the sly shooter of men,anapaestic,10
149929,young cupid i beg the god's pardon,anapaestic,10
149930,mamma your blue birds i have seen,anapaestic,10
149931,in a certain terrestrial garden,anapaestic,10
149932,where where my dear child quickly shew,anapaestic,10
149933,quoth the dame almost out of her wits,anapaestic,10
149934,do but go to chlorinda's says cu,anapaestic,10
149935,and you'll find 'em in shape of pewits,anapaestic,10
149936,is it she that hath done me this wrong,anapaestic,10
149937,full well i know her and her arts,anapaestic,10
149938,she has follow'd the thieving trade long,anapaestic,10
149939,but i thought she dealt only in hearts,anapaestic,10
149940,i shall soon make her know so i shall,anapaestic,10
149941,and with that to jove's palace she run,anapaestic,10
149942,and began like a bedlam to bawl,anapaestic,10
149943,i am cheated i'm robb'd i'm undone,anapaestic,10
149944,chlorinda whom none can approach,anapaestic,10
149945,without losing his heart or his senses,anapaestic,10
149946,has stol'n the two doves from my coach,anapaestic,10
149947,and now flaunts it at venus' expences,anapaestic,10
149948,she has chang'd the poor things to pewits,anapaestic,10
149949,and keeps 'em like ord'nary fowls,anapaestic,10
149950,so when she robs men of their wits,anapaestic,10
149951,she turns 'em to asses or owls,anapaestic,10
149952,i cou'd tell you of many a hundred,anapaestic,10
149953,of figure high station and means,anapaestic,10
149954,whom she without mercy has plunder'd,anapaestic,10
149955,ever since she came into her teens,anapaestic,10
149956,but her thefts upon earth i'd have borne,anapaestic,10
149957,or have let 'em all pass for mere fable,anapaestic,10
149958,but nothing will now serve her turn,anapaestic,10
149959,but the doves out of venus's stable,anapaestic,10
149960,is it fit let your mighty ship say,anapaestic,10
149961,that i like some pitiful flirt,anapaestic,10
149962,shou'd tarry within doors all day,anapaestic,10
149963,or else trudge it afoot in the dirt,anapaestic,10
149964,is it fit that a mortal shou'd trample,anapaestic,10
149965,on me who am styl'd queen of beauty,anapaestic,10
149966,o make her great jove an example,anapaestic,10
149967,and teach nimblefingers her duty,anapaestic,10
149968,sir jove when he heard her thus rage,anapaestic,10
149969,for all his great gravity smil'd,anapaestic,10
149970,and then like a judge wise and sage,anapaestic,10
149971,he began in terms sober and mild,anapaestic,10
149972,learn daughter to bridle your tongue,anapaestic,10
149973,forbear to traduce with your prattle,anapaestic,10
149974,the fair who has done you no wrong,anapaestic,10
149975,and scorns to purloin goods and chattel,anapaestic,10
149976,she needs neither gewgaw nor trinket,anapaestic,10
149977,to carry the world all before her,anapaestic,10
149978,her deserts i wou'd have you to think it,anapaestic,10
149979,are enough to make all men adore her,anapaestic,10
149980,your doves are elop'd i confess,anapaestic,10
149981,and chuse with chlorinda to dwell,anapaestic,10
149982,but blame not the lady for this,anapaestic,10
149983,for sure 'tis no crime to excel,anapaestic,10
149984,as for them i applaud their high aims,anapaestic,10
149985,having serv'd from the time of their birth,anapaestic,10
149986,the fairest of heavenly dames,anapaestic,10
149987,they would now serve the fairest on earth,anapaestic,10
172699,though bacchus may boast of his carekilling bowl,anapaestic,10
172700,such worship alas has no charms for the soul,anapaestic,10
172701,to the arrow of fate or the canker of care,anapaestic,10
172702,but to fancy that feeds on the charms of the fair,anapaestic,10
172703,what soul that's possess'd of a dream so divine,anapaestic,10
172704,for the tear that bedews sensibility's shrine,anapaestic,10
172705,the tender excess which enamours the heart,anapaestic,10
172706,of those exquisite feelings that please tho' we smart,anapaestic,10
172707,each change and excess have thro' life been my doom,anapaestic,10
172708,the bottle affords us a glimpse through the gloom,anapaestic,10
172709,come then rosy venus and spread o'er my sight,anapaestic,10
172710,awake in my breast the soft dream of delight,anapaestic,10
172711,then deep will i drink of the nectar divine,anapaestic,10
172712,each throb of my heart shall accord with the wine,anapaestic,10
172713,and now my gay comrades the myrtle and vine,anapaestic,10
172714,let reason not riot the garland entwine,anapaestic,10
174183,fairest flow'r all flow'rs excelling,trochaic,8
174184,which in eden's garden grew,trochaic,8
174185,flow'rs of eve's' imbower'd dwellinga,trochaic,8
174186,are my fairone types of you,trochaic,8
174187,mark my polly how the roses,trochaic,8
174188,emulate thy damask cheek,trochaic,8
174189,how the bud its sweets discloses,trochaic,8
174190,buds thy opening bloom bespeak,trochaic,8
174191,lilies are by plain direction,trochaic,8
174192,emblems of a double kind,trochaic,8
174193,emblems of thy fair complexion,trochaic,8
174194,emblems of thy fairer mind,trochaic,8
174195,but dear girl both flow'rs and beauty,trochaic,8
174196,blossom fade and die away,trochaic,8
174197,then pursue good sense and duty,trochaic,8
174198,evergreens that ne'er decay,trochaic,8
174518,i hope sir by this you have found your account,anapaestic,10
174519,in visiting airy and seeing his mount,anapaestic,10
174520,if froth can delight you you're wonderous happy,anapaestic,10
174521,and we know it gives joy on a bottle of nappy,anapaestic,10
174522,your friend would be very much mended in troth,anapaestic,10
174523,should airy bestow him a dash of his froth,anapaestic,10
174524,to keep up the metaphor 'twould make him mellow,anapaestic,10
174525,and of a sour stoic a pleasant young fellow,anapaestic,10
174526,and airy be recompens'd well for that favour,anapaestic,10
174527,if your friend in return should make him grow graver,anapaestic,10
174528,this exchange should they make it would set 'em both right,anapaestic,10
174529,since one is too solid and t'other too light,anapaestic,10
174951,prythee why so fantastick and vain,anapaestic,10
174952,what charms can the toilet supply,anapaestic,10
174953,why so studious admirers to gain,anapaestic,10
174954,need beauty lay traps for the eye,anapaestic,10
174955,because that thy breast is so fair,anapaestic,10
174956,must thy tucker be still setting right,anapaestic,10
174957,and canst thou not laughing forbear,anapaestic,10
174958,because that thy teeth are so white,anapaestic,10
174959,shall sovereign beauty descend,anapaestic,10
174960,to act so ignoble a part,anapaestic,10
174961,whole hours at the lookingglass spend,anapaestic,10
174962,a slave to the dictates of art,anapaestic,10
174963,and cannot thy heart be at rest,anapaestic,10
174964,unless thou excellest each fair,anapaestic,10
174965,in trinkets and trumpery dress'd,anapaestic,10
174966,is not that a superfluous care,anapaestic,10
174967,vain idle attempt to pretend,anapaestic,10
174968,the lilly with whiteness to deck,anapaestic,10
174969,does the rich solitaire recommend,anapaestic,10
174970,the delicate turn of thy neck,anapaestic,10
174971,the glossy bright hue of thy hair,anapaestic,10
174972,can powder or jewels adorn,anapaestic,10
174973,can perfumes or vermilions compare,anapaestic,10
174974,with the breath or the blush of the morn,anapaestic,10
174975,when embarrass'd with baubles and toys,anapaestic,10
174976,thou'rt set out so enormously fine,anapaestic,10
174977,overdoing thy purpose destroys,anapaestic,10
174978,and to please thou hast too much design,anapaestic,10
174979,little know'st thou how beauty beguiles,anapaestic,10
174980,how alluring the innocent eye,anapaestic,10
174981,what sweetness in natural smiles,anapaestic,10
174982,and what charms in simplicity lye,anapaestic,10
174983,thee nature with beauty has clad,anapaestic,10
174984,with genuine ornaments dress'd,anapaestic,10
174985,nor can art an embellishment add,anapaestic,10
174986,to set off what already is best,anapaestic,10
174987,be it thine selfaccomplish'd to reign,anapaestic,10
174988,bid the toilet be far set apart,anapaestic,10
174989,and dismiss with an honest disdain,anapaestic,10
174990,that impertinent abigail art,anapaestic,10
175473,say sad tenant of the grove,trochaic,8
175474,whence the pains that now you prove,trochaic,8
175475,why within your throbbing breast,trochaic,8
175476,why is sorrow still a guest,trochaic,8
175477,sleeps in death your murder'd mate,trochaic,8
175478,weep'st thou his melancholy fate,trochaic,8
175479,if 'tis that disturbs thy peace,trochaic,8
175480,spring shall bid thy sorrows cease,trochaic,8
175481,then thy breast that heaves in woe,trochaic,8
175482,with love's bright flame again shall glow,trochaic,8
175483,yet sweet mourner still complain,trochaic,8
175484,nor though bless'd forbear thy strain,trochaic,8
175485,for sweetly sad thy warblings flow,trochaic,8
175486,and charming is thy song of woe,trochaic,8
175487,as at eve he treads the plain,trochaic,8
175488,oft it soothes the shepherd swain,trochaic,8
175489,when he seeks the conscious shade,trochaic,8
175490,there to meet the village maid,trochaic,8
175491,he with rapture hears thy lay,trochaic,8
175492,issue from the hawthorn spray,trochaic,8
175493,and with mine unites his praise,trochaic,8
175494,of philomela's tender lays,trochaic,8
176382,the minutes the hours the days and the years,anapaestic,10
176383,that fill up the current of time,anapaestic,10
176384,neither flowing with hopes neither ebbing with fears,anapaestic,10
176385,unheeded roll'd on to my prime,anapaestic,10
176386,in infancy prattling in youth full of play,anapaestic,10
176387,still pleas'd with whatever was new,anapaestic,10
176388,i bad the old cripple fly swifter away,anapaestic,10
176389,to o'ertake some gay trifle in view,anapaestic,10
176390,but when chloe with sweetness and sense in her look,anapaestic,10
176391,first taught me the lesson of love,anapaestic,10
176392,then i counted each step the wing'd fugitive took,anapaestic,10
176393,and bad him more leisurely move,anapaestic,10
176394,stop runaway stop nor thy journey pursue,anapaestic,10
176395,for chloe has gi'en me her heart,anapaestic,10
176396,to enjoy it thy years will prove many too few,anapaestic,10
176397,if you make so much haste to depart,anapaestic,10
176398,still still he flies on still still let him fly,anapaestic,10
176399,'till he's tired and panting for breath,anapaestic,10
176400,my love both his teeth and his scythe shall defy,anapaestic,10
176401,that can only be conquer'd by death,anapaestic,10
177282,happy verses that were prest,trochaic,8
177283,in fair ethelinda's breast,trochaic,8
177284,happy muse that didst embrace,trochaic,8
177285,the sweet the heav'nlyfragrant place,trochaic,8
177286,tell me is the omen true,trochaic,8
177287,shall the bard arrive there too,trochaic,8
177288,oft thro' my eyes my soul has flown,trochaic,8
177289,and wanton'd on that ivory throne,trochaic,8
177290,there with extatic transport burn'd,trochaic,8
177291,and thought it was to heav'n return'd,trochaic,8
177293,shall the body follow too,trochaic,8
177294,when first at nature's early birth,trochaic,8
177295,heav'n sent a man upon the earth,trochaic,8
177296,ev'n eden was more fruitful found,trochaic,8
177297,when adam came to till the ground,trochaic,8
177298,shall then those breasts be fair in vain,trochaic,8
177299,and only rise to fall again,trochaic,8
177300,no no fair nymph for no such end,trochaic,8
177301,did heav'n to thee its bounty lend,trochaic,8
177302,that breast was ne'er design'd by fate,trochaic,8
177303,for verse or things inanimate,trochaic,8
177304,then throw them from that downy bed,trochaic,8

177400,fame is thine lo crowds aver it,trochaic,8
177401,but i charge thee don't prefer it,trochaic,8
177402,thou thy country's call obeying,trochaic,8
177403,and thy ready zeal repaying,trochaic,8
177404,but have i no claims my rover,trochaic,8
177405,yes o yes and wandering over,trochaic,8
177406,ha methinks thy glances reading,trochaic,8
177407,duty still love's claim impeding,trochaic,8
177408,of my fears too dread revival,trochaic,8
177409,yet with tearful joy i see,trochaic,8
177410,potent over love and me,trochaic,8
177924,hy would you know the passion,trochaic,8
177925,you have kindled in my breast,trochaic,8
177926,trifling is the inclination,trochaic,8
177927,that by words can be express'd,trochaic,8
177928,in my silence see the lover,trochaic,8
177929,true love is by silence known,trochaic,8
177930,in my eyes you'll best discover,trochaic,8
177931,all the power of your own,trochaic,8
178173,love's gay queen who reigns on earth,trochaic,8
178174,smil'd miranda at thy birth,trochaic,8
178175,pleas'd she bid thy angel face,trochaic,8
178176,beam with each bewitching grace,trochaic,8
178177,round your waist her zone she threw,trochaic,8
178178,charms divine thus giving you,trochaic,8
178179,cupid knelt and lowting low,trochaic,8

178183,pallas then the work to crown,trochaic,8
178184,made her aegis all your own,trochaic,8
179686,apollo of old on britannia did smile,anapaestic,10
179687,and delphi forsook for the sake of this isle,anapaestic,10
179688,around him he lavishly scatter'd his lays,anapaestic,10
179689,and in every wilderness planted his bays,anapaestic,10
179690,then chaucer and spenser harmonious were heard,anapaestic,10
179691,then shakespear and milton and waller appear'd,anapaestic,10
179692,and dryden whose brows by apollo were crown'd,anapaestic,10
179693,as he sung in such strains as the god might have own'd,anapaestic,10
179694,but now since the laurel is given of late,anapaestic,10
179695,to cibber to eusden to shadwell and tate,anapaestic,10
179696,apollo hath quitted the isle he once lov'd,anapaestic,10
179697,and his harp and his bays to hibernia remov'd,anapaestic,10
179698,he vows and he swears he'll inspire us no more,anapaestic,10
179699,and has put out pope's fires which he kindled before,anapaestic,10
179700,and further he says men no longer shall boast,anapaestic,10
179701,a science their slight and ill treatment hath lost,anapaestic,10
179702,but that women alone for the future shall write,anapaestic,10
179703,and who can resist when they doubly delight,anapaestic,10
179704,and lest we shou'd doubt what he said to be true,anapaestic,10
179705,has begun by inspiring saphira and you,anapaestic,10
179805,tho' the plumb and the peach with apollo conspire,anapaestic,10
179806,to present you their softness and sweetness and fire,anapaestic,10
179807,their aid is in vain for what can they do,anapaestic,10
179808,but blush and confess them selves vanquish'd by you,anapaestic,10
179809,where virtue and wit with such qualities blend,anapaestic,10
179810,what mortal what goddess would dare to contend,anapaestic,10
181653,can ease be consistent with state,anapaestic,10
181654,can freedom and pomp thus agree,anapaestic,10
181655,o stanhope who wou'd not be great,anapaestic,10
181656,if easy in greatness like thee,anapaestic,10
181657,let statesmen pretend to despise,anapaestic,10
181658,those talents that furnish delight,anapaestic,10
181659,'tis stanhope's alone to be wise,anapaestic,10
181660,yet pleasure with wisdom unite,anapaestic,10
181661,state burthens with form the gay soul,anapaestic,10
181662,unbended alone we taste joy,anapaestic,10
181663,too soon our grey hairs must controul,anapaestic,10
181664,that bliss which our prime should employ,anapaestic,10
181665,then stanhope be blest in your choice,anapaestic,10
181666,be happy your life in each stage,anapaestic,10
181667,while spirits attend you rejoice,anapaestic,10
181668,you've wisdom enough for old age,anapaestic,10
183353,that your honour's petitioners dealers in rhyme,anapaestic,10
183354,and writers of scandal for mending the times,anapaestic,10
183355,by losses in bus'ness and england's welldoing,anapaestic,10
183356,are sunk in their credit and verging on ruin,anapaestic,10
183357,that these their misfortunes they humbly conceive,anapaestic,10
183358,arise not from dulness as some folks believe,anapaestic,10
183359,but from rubs in their way that your honour has laid,anapaestic,10
183360,and want of materials to carry on trade,anapaestic,10
183361,that they always had form'd high conceits of their use,anapaestic,10
183362,and meant their last breath should go out in abuse,anapaestic,10
183363,but now and they speak it with sorrow and tears,anapaestic,10
183364,since your honour has sate at the helm of affairs,anapaestic,10
183365,no party will join 'em no faction invite,anapaestic,10
183366,to heed what they say or to read what they write,anapaestic,10
183367,sedition and tumult and discord are fled,anapaestic,10
183368,and slander scarce ventures to lift up her head,anapaestic,10
183369,in short publick bus'ness is so carry'd on,anapaestic,10
183370,that their country is sav'd and the patriots undone,anapaestic,10
183371,to perplex 'em still more and sure famine to bring,anapaestic,10
183372,now satire has lost both its truth and its sting,anapaestic,10
183373,if in spite of their natures they bungle at praise,anapaestic,10
183374,your honour regards not and nobody pays,anapaestic,10
183375,your petitioners therefore most humbly entreat,anapaestic,10
183376,as times will allow and your honour thinks meet,anapaestic,10
183377,that measures be chang'd and some cause of complaint,anapaestic,10
183378,be immediately furnish'd to end their restraint,anapaestic,10
183379,their credit thereby and their trade to retrieve,anapaestic,10
183380,that again they may rail and the nation believe,anapaestic,10
183381,or else if your wisdom shall deem it all one,anapaestic,10
183382,now the parliament's rising and bus'ness is done,anapaestic,10
183383,that your honour would please at this dangerous crisis,anapaestic,10
183384,to take to your bosom a few private vices,anapaestic,10
183385,by which your petitioners haply might thrive,anapaestic,10
183386,and keep both themselves and contention alive,anapaestic,10
183387,in compassion good sir give 'em something to say,anapaestic,10
183388,and your honour's petitioners ever shall pray,anapaestic,10
183555,tho' the muse had deny'd me so often before,anapaestic,10
183556,i ventur'd this day to invoke her once more,anapaestic,10
183557,she ask'd what i wanted i said with delight,anapaestic,10
183558,your lordship had promis'd to sup here tonight,anapaestic,10
183559,that on an occasion so much to my honour,anapaestic,10
183560,i hop'd she'd excuse me for calling upon her,anapaestic,10
183561,to this she reply'd with disdain in her looks,anapaestic,10
183562,if that be the case go summon your cooks,anapaestic,10
183563,i told her in answer how little you eat,anapaestic,10
183564,that in vain i should hope to regale you with meat,anapaestic,10
183565,that she knew wit and humour to you were a feast,anapaestic,10
183566,who had tho' no stomach an excellent taste,anapaestic,10
183567,this calm'd her resentment she paus'd for a while,anapaestic,10
183568,then the goddess propitious reply'd with a smile,anapaestic,10
183569,if with humour and wit you would have him delighted,anapaestic,10
183570,what need i be call'd let the dean be invited,anapaestic,10
183571,the bus'ness is done if with him you prevail,anapaestic,10
183572,for a boyle and a swift will each other regale,anapaestic,10
183641,to the late king of britain a savage was brought,anapaestic,10
183642,which wild in the woods of germania was caught,anapaestic,10
183643,this present so princely was train'd up with care,anapaestic,10
183644,and knew how to eat and to jump and to stare,anapaestic,10
183645,the beaux and the belles beheld it with joy,anapaestic,10
183646,and at court the high mode was to see the wild boy,anapaestic,10
183647,reflecting on this with a politic view,anapaestic,10
183648,i determin'd to send such a present to you,anapaestic,10
183649,in the wilds of hibernia this boy was beset,anapaestic,10
183650,and caught as the natives are there in a net,anapaestic,10
183651,the creature has sense and in my eyes is pretty,anapaestic,10
183652,with talents to make a good man in the city,anapaestic,10
183653,industrious and orderly prudent and smart,anapaestic,10
183654,and not too much conscience nor too little art,anapaestic,10
183655,not scrup'lous but honest a heart set on gain,anapaestic,10
183656,whose highest ambition is fix'd on the chain,anapaestic,10
183657,from you may he copy to wear it with glory,anapaestic,10
183658,like you in return be honour'd in story,anapaestic,10
184063,i blame all the fears i gave way to before,anapaestic,10
184064,i say to my heart be at rest and believe,anapaestic,10
184065,that whom once she has chosen she never will leave,anapaestic,10
184066,but ah when i think on each ravishing grace,anapaestic,10
184067,that plays in the smiles of that heavenly face,anapaestic,10
184068,my heart beats again i again apprehend,anapaestic,10
184069,some fortunate rival in every friend,anapaestic,10
184070,these painful suspicions you cannot remove,anapaestic,10
184071,since you neither can lessen your charms nor my love,anapaestic,10
184072,but doubts caus'd by passion you never can blame,anapaestic,10
184073,for they are not ill founded or you feel the same,anapaestic,10
184370,to speed the sad moments away,anapaestic,10
184371,which by absence seem tedious and slow,anapaestic,10
184372,attend my dear girl to the lay,anapaestic,10
184373,that love taught so sweetly to flow,anapaestic,10
184374,thro' the regions of quiet and joy,anapaestic,10
184375,as led by the muses you stray,anapaestic,10
184376,oh think that your damon is by,anapaestic,10
184377,and that such are the words he would say,anapaestic,10
184378,such may be the words he might say,anapaestic,10
184379,but what words can his passion impart,anapaestic,10
184380,or how shall he form the soft lay,anapaestic,10
184381,to express what he feels at his heart,anapaestic,10
184382,tho' thy voice gentle shepherd was clear,anapaestic,10
184383,tho' the bower of contentment was thine,anapaestic,10
184384,yet thy shepherdess was not so fair,anapaestic,10
184385,yet thy love was not equal to mine,anapaestic,10
184795,how sweet to the heart is the thought of tomorrow,anapaestic,10
184796,how sweet when we can from futurity borrow,anapaestic,10
184797,when wearisome sickness has taught me to languish,anapaestic,10
184798,let me hope ah how soon would it lessen my anguish,anapaestic,10
184799,the pilgrim sojourning alone unbefriended,anapaestic,10
184800,that at home and with care sympathetic attended,anapaestic,10
184801,when six days of labour each other succeeding,anapaestic,10
184802,what pleasure to think as the last is receding,anapaestic,10
184803,and when the vain shadows of time are retiring,anapaestic,10
184804,the christian believing exulting expiring,anapaestic,10
184805,the infidel then sees no joyous tomorrow,anapaestic,10
184806,poor wretch can he feel without heartrending sorrow,anapaestic,10

185078,to gladden this ignoble shade,trochaic,8
185079,so peace endear this humble plain,trochaic,8
185080,and haply elegance will deign,trochaic,8

187484,had taken too freely the cheeruping cup,anapaestic,10
187485,and repeated the dose till it laid her quite up,anapaestic,10
187486,colin sent for the doctor with sorrowful face,anapaestic,10
187487,he gave him his fee and he told him her case,anapaestic,10
187488,quoth galen i'll do what i can for your wife,anapaestic,10
187489,but indeed she's so bad that i fear for her life,anapaestic,10
187490,in counsel there's safety e'en send for another,anapaestic,10
187491,for if she shou'd die folks will make a strange pother,anapaestic,10
187492,and say that i lost her for want of good skill,anapaestic,10
187493,or of better advice or in short what they will,anapaestic,10
187494,says colin your judgment there's none can dispute,anapaestic,10
187495,and if physic can cure her i know yours will do't,anapaestic,10
187496,but if after all she shou'd happen to die,anapaestic,10
187497,and they say that you kill'd her i'll swear 'tis a lye,anapaestic,10
187498,'tis the husband's chief business whatever ensue,anapaestic,10
187499,and whoever finds fault i'll be shot if i do,anapaestic,10
190262,the slightest of favours bestow'd by the fair,anapaestic,10
190263,with rapture we take and with transport we wear,anapaestic,10
190264,but a mosswoven rosebud eliza from thee,anapaestic,10
190265,a wellpleasing gift to a monarch would be,anapaestic,10
190266,ah that illness too cruel forbidding should stand,anapaestic,10
190267,and refuse me the gift from thine own lovely hand,anapaestic,10
190268,with joy i receive it with pleasure will view,anapaestic,10
190269,reminded of thee by its odour and hue,anapaestic,10
190270,sweet rose let me tell thee tho' charming thy bloom,anapaestic,10
190271,tho' thy fragrance exceeds saba's richest perfume,anapaestic,10
190272,thy breath to eliza's hath no fragrance in't,anapaestic,10
190273,and thy bloom is but dull to her cheeks blushing tint,anapaestic,10
190274,yet alas my fair flower that bloom will decay,anapaestic,10
190275,and all thy fine beauties soon wither away,anapaestic,10
190276,tho' pluck'd by her hand to whose touch thou must own,anapaestic,10
190277,harsh and rough is the cygnet's most delicate down,anapaestic,10
190278,thou too snowy hand nay i mean not to preach,anapaestic,10

190280,extol not fond maiden thy beauties o'er mine,anapaestic,10
190281,they too are shortliv'd and they too must decline,anapaestic,10
190282,and small in conclusion the difference appears,anapaestic,10
190283,in the bloom of few days or the bloom of few years,anapaestic,10
190284,but remember a virtue the rose hath to boast,anapaestic,10
190285,its fragrance remains when its beauties are lost,anapaestic,10

192131,my right there is none to dispute,anapaestic,10
192132,from the center all round to the sea,anapaestic,10
192133,i am lord of the fowl and the brute,anapaestic,10
192134,oh solitude where are the charms,anapaestic,10
192135,that sages have seen in the face,anapaestic,10
192136,better dwell in the midst of alarms,anapaestic,10
192137,than reign in this horrible place,anapaestic,10
192138,i am out of humanity's reach,anapaestic,10
192139,i must finish my journey alone,anapaestic,10
192140,never hear the sweet music of speech,anapaestic,10
192141,i start at the sound of my own,anapaestic,10
192142,the beasts that roam over the plain,anapaestic,10
192143,my form with indifference see,anapaestic,10
192144,they are so unacquainted with man,anapaestic,10
192145,their tameness is shocking to me,anapaestic,10
192146,society friendship and love,anapaestic,10
192147,divinely bestow'd upon man,anapaestic,10
192148,oh had i the wings of a dove,anapaestic,10
192149,how soon wou'd i taste you again,anapaestic,10
192150,my sorrows i then might assuage,anapaestic,10
192151,in the ways of religion and truth,anapaestic,10
192152,might learn from the wisdom of age,anapaestic,10
192153,and be cheer'd by the fallies of youth,anapaestic,10
192154,religion what treasure untold,anapaestic,10
192155,resides in that heav'nly word,anapaestic,10
192156,more precious than silver and gold,anapaestic,10
192157,or all that this earth can afford,anapaestic,10
192158,but the sound of the church going bell,anapaestic,10
192159,these vallies and rocks never heard,anapaestic,10
192160,ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell,anapaestic,10
192161,or smil'd when a sabbath appear'd,anapaestic,10
192162,ye winds that have made me your sport,anapaestic,10
192163,convey to this desolate shore,anapaestic,10
192164,some cordial endearing report,anapaestic,10
192165,of a land i shall visit no more,anapaestic,10
192166,my friends do they now and then send,anapaestic,10
192167,a wish or a thought after me,anapaestic,10
192168,o tell me i yet have a friend,anapaestic,10
192169,though a friend i am never to see,anapaestic,10
192170,how fleet is a glance of the mind,anapaestic,10
192171,compar'd with the speed of its flight,anapaestic,10
192172,the tempest itself lags behind,anapaestic,10
192173,and the swift winged arrows of light,anapaestic,10
192174,when i think of my own native land,anapaestic,10
192175,in a moment i seem to be there,anapaestic,10
192176,but alas recollection at hand,anapaestic,10
192177,soon hurries me back to despair,anapaestic,10
192178,but the sea fowl is gone to her nest,anapaestic,10
192179,the beast is laid down in his lair,anapaestic,10
192180,ev'n here is a season of rest,anapaestic,10
192181,and i to my cabbin repair,anapaestic,10
192182,there is mercy in ev'ry place,anapaestic,10
192183,and mercy encouraging thought,anapaestic,10
192184,gives even affliction a grace,anapaestic,10
192185,and reconciles man to his lot,anapaestic,10
192194,i lives in a neat little cottage,anapaestic,10
192195,on sundays i dresses me handsome,anapaestic,10
192196,i goes to the sign of the anchor,anapaestic,10
192197,to wait till the lads are all ready,anapaestic,10
192198,o lozes o' me we are merry,anapaestic,10
192199,dick spriggins he acts sae like players,anapaestic,10
192200,and first he comes in for king richard,anapaestic,10
192201,he wad part with his kingdom for horses,anapaestic,10
192202,and then he comes in for young roma,anapaestic,10
192203,i's just fit to drop whilst he's talking,anapaestic,10
192204,o lozes o' me it is moving,anapaestic,10
192205,and then he looks up at a window,anapaestic,10
192206,and then he lets wit' at she's talking,anapaestic,10
192207,but i think she caws out on squire roma,anapaestic,10
192208,then up wi' dick spriggins for ever,anapaestic,10
192209,may his bairns be as honest as he's been,anapaestic,10
193180,sir walter returned from the far holy land,anapaestic,10
193181,but such precious blood as now darkened his sword,anapaestic,10
193182,fast fluttered his heart as his own castle towers,anapaestic,10
193183,my wife and my son he exclaimed while his tears,anapaestic,10
193184,for terror now whispered the wife he had left,anapaestic,10
193185,the child he had claspt in his farewel embrace,anapaestic,10
193186,then sighing he thought of his editha's tears,anapaestic,10
193187,and her accents of love while she fervently cried,anapaestic,10
193188,and then he remembered in language half formed,anapaestic,10
193189,while scarcely he now can believe as a man,anapaestic,10
193190,but should he not live to escape from that fear,anapaestic,10
193191,nor stopped he again till his own castle moat,anapaestic,10
193192,'t was daybreak yet still past the windows he saw,anapaestic,10
193193,blest sight that she lives he exclaimed with smile,anapaestic,10
193194,for stranger to sloth and on business intent,anapaestic,10
193195,and see through the castle all busy appear,anapaestic,10
193196,that instant the knight by the warder was seen,anapaestic,10
193197,and while loud blew the horn now a smile now a tear,anapaestic,10
193198,'tis i my loved vassals the warrior exclaimed,anapaestic,10
193199,who breathless and speechless soon rushed to his arms,anapaestic,10
193200,and dost thou still love me he uttered when first,anapaestic,10
193201,she tried to reply but in vain while her sobs,anapaestic,10
193202,behold how i'm changed how i'm scarred he exclaimed,anapaestic,10
193203,thou hast bled for thy god she replied and each scar,anapaestic,10
193204,but where is my child he cried pale with alarm,anapaestic,10
193205,and comes he not with you she said then some woe,anapaestic,10
193206,what meanest thou my love when to manhood he grew,anapaestic,10
193207,'o let me' he cried 'to the holy land go,anapaestic,10
193208,'perchance my young arm by the cause nerved with strength,anapaestic,10
193209,and the brave christian knights in reward of my zeal,anapaestic,10
193210,'and think'st thou' i said 'with the son i can part,anapaestic,10
193211,no hope not i'll add to the fears of the wife,anapaestic,10
193212,i ceased and his head on my bosom reclined,anapaestic,10
193213,when parting his ringlets i saw the big tears,anapaestic,10
193214,the sight overcame me 'most loved' i exclaimed,anapaestic,10
193215,thy mother will gladly to dry up thy tears,anapaestic,10
193216,he kissed me he thanked me i armed him myself,anapaestic,10
193217,so lovely he looked that the mother's fond fears,anapaestic,10
193218,he went then how long has my warrior been gone,anapaestic,10
193219,indeed then he scarcely could reach the far land,anapaestic,10
193220,i told him my walter what armour was yours,anapaestic,10
193221,in hopes of your meeting alas he returned,anapaestic,10
193222,a friend whom i loved from the dawning of youth,anapaestic,10
193223,fell fighting beside me and thus he exclaimed,anapaestic,10
193224,'and must i then die ere the flag of the cross,anapaestic,10
193225,but grant me loved walter this dying request,anapaestic,10
193226,'my armour well tried and my falchion my shield,anapaestic,10
193227,'t would sooth me to know when the victory comes on,anapaestic,10
193228,i granted his wish and his arms i assumed,anapaestic,10
193229,and marked with delight that his last closing look,anapaestic,10
193230,yet now this remembrance so dear to my heart,anapaestic,10
193231,since but for this change on the field of the fight,anapaestic,10
193232,but if he has fought and has fallen my love,anapaestic,10
193233,a fear so illfounded if alfred had died,anapaestic,10
193234,yet vainly he strove by the father's proud hopes,anapaestic,10
193235,he feared for the life of his boy though with smiles,anapaestic,10
193236,and more and more forced grew the smile on his lip,anapaestic,10
193237,at length he exclaimed from the field of renown,anapaestic,10
193238,i grieve that i won it a saracen chief,anapaestic,10
193239,when lo as i claimed him my prisoner and prize,anapaestic,10
193240,'i'm new to the battle' he cried 'and this prize,anapaestic,10
193241,nor will i the conquest resign but with life,anapaestic,10
193242,his daring enraged me for mine seemed the stroke,anapaestic,10
193243,besides from his bosom depended no cross,anapaestic,10
193244,but surely my walter the daring bespoke,anapaestic,10
193245,so many your laurels that one you could spare,anapaestic,10
193246,no editha no martial pride steeled my heart,anapaestic,10
193247,he fought like a hero but vainly he fought,anapaestic,10
193248,o illfated youth how i bleed for his fate,anapaestic,10
193249,had armed him and blest him and prays for his life,anapaestic,10
193250,but never again shall he gladden her eyes,anapaestic,10
193251,o walter i tremble lest you in return,anapaestic,10
193252,say did not the cross when your victim he fell,anapaestic,10
193253,that symbol of him full of meekness and love,anapaestic,10
193254,yes pity shame penitence seized on my soul,anapaestic,10
193255,methought as he lay and in agony groaned,anapaestic,10
193256,his casque i unlaced and i chafed his cold brow,anapaestic,10
193257,so young and so lovely he seemed that i wept,anapaestic,10
193258,he saw my distress and his last dying grasp,anapaestic,10
193259,and then with a look i shall never forget,anapaestic,10
193260,but what's this memorial with cheek deadly pale,anapaestic,10
193261,this scarf from his bosom he uttered no more,anapaestic,10
193262,ah then in her danger her pale look of death,anapaestic,10

193435,lord help te sud beggars yence rule us,anapaestic,10
193436,what is't then but law that stands by us,anapaestic,10
193437,and as to being parfet and parfet,anapaestic,10
193454,when home we return after youth has been spending,anapaestic,10
193455,and many a slow year has been wasting and ending,anapaestic,10
193456,we often seem lost in the once wellknown places,anapaestic,10
193457,and sigh to find age has so furrow'd dear faces,anapaestic,10
193458,for the rose that has faded the eye still keeps mourning,anapaestic,10
193459,and weeps every change that it sees on returning,anapaestic,10
193460,should we miss but a tree where we us'd to be playing,anapaestic,10
193461,or find the wood cut where we saunter'd amaying,anapaestic,10
193462,if the yewseat's away or the ivy's awanting,anapaestic,10
193463,we hate the fine lawn and the newfashion'd planting,anapaestic,10
193464,each thing call'd improvement seems blacken'd with crimes,anapaestic,10
193465,if it tears up one record of blissful old times,anapaestic,10
193466,when many a spring had call'd forth the sweet flowers,anapaestic,10
193467,and many an autumn had painted the bowers,anapaestic,10
193468,i came to the place where life had its beginning,anapaestic,10
193469,taking root with the groves that around me were springing,anapaestic,10
193470,when i found them all gone 'twas like dear friends departed,anapaestic,10
193471,and i walk'd where they us'd to be half broken hearted,anapaestic,10
193472,when distant one bower my fancy still haunted,anapaestic,10
193473,'twas hung round with woodbine my jessy had planted,anapaestic,10
193474,i ran to the spot where a weak flower remaining,anapaestic,10
193475,could just nod its head to approve my complaining,anapaestic,10
193476,a tear for a dewdrop i hid in its fringes,anapaestic,10
193477,and sigh'd then to think what one's pleasures unhinges,anapaestic,10
193478,but ah what is that to the friends oft estranging,anapaestic,10
193479,their manners still more than their looks daily changing,anapaestic,10
193480,where the heart us'd to warm to find civil behaviour,anapaestic,10
193481,make us wish we had stay'd from our country for ever,anapaestic,10
193482,with the sweet days of youth in our fancies still glowing,anapaestic,10
193483,and the love of old friends with old time ever growing,anapaestic,10
193496,when severest foes impending,trochaic,8
193497,unexpected joys attending,trochaic,8
193498,though to fortune's frowns subjected,trochaic,8
193499,servile souls are soon dejected,trochaic,8
193500,prithee friend why then so serious,trochaic,8
193501,melancholy grows imperious,trochaic,8
193502,be it business love or sorrow,trochaic,8
193503,bid them call again tomorrow,trochaic,8
193504,when the soft tear steals silently down from the eye,anapaestic,10
193505,take no note of its course nor detect the slow sigh,anapaestic,10
193506,from some spring of shy sorrow its origin flows,anapaestic,10
193507,some tender remembrance that weeps as it goes,anapaestic,10
193508,ah it is not to say what will bring to the mind,anapaestic,10
193509,the sweet joys departed the friends left behind,anapaestic,10
193510,a tune or a song or the time of the year,anapaestic,10
193511,strikes the key of reflection and moans in the ear,anapaestic,10
193512,thro' the gay scenes of youth the remembrancer strays,anapaestic,10
193513,till mem'ry steps back on old pleasures to gaze,anapaestic,10
193514,fleeting shadows they seem that glide calmly away,anapaestic,10
193515,the remains of past hours and the ghosts of a day,anapaestic,10
193516,when we set out in life every thing has its charms,anapaestic,10
193517,enkindles the fancy and all the heart warms,anapaestic,10
193518,'tis this makes us look on the joys that are past,anapaestic,10
193519,with an eye that turns coolly to glance on the last,anapaestic,10
193520,let the tear then flow on nor mark the full eye,anapaestic,10
193521,'tis the soul's secret off'ring no mortal should spy,anapaestic,10
193522,few hearts are prepar'd for a rite so divine,anapaestic,10
193523,when the feelings alone sacrifice at the shrine,anapaestic,10
193524,when the sunbeams of joy gild the morn of our days,anapaestic,10
193525,and the soft heart is warm'd both with hope and with praise,anapaestic,10
193526,new pleasures new prospects still burst on the view,anapaestic,10
193527,and the phantom of bliss in our walks we pursue,anapaestic,10
193528,what tho' tangl'd in brakes or withheld by the thorn,anapaestic,10
193529,such sorrows of youth are but pearls of the morn,anapaestic,10
193530,as they gem the light leaf in the fervour of day,anapaestic,10
193531,the warmth of the season dissolves them away,anapaestic,10
193532,in the noontide of life though not robb'd of their fire,anapaestic,10
193533,the warm wishes abate and the spirits retire,anapaestic,10
193534,thus pictures less glowing give equal delight,anapaestic,10
193535,when reason just tints them with shades of the night,anapaestic,10
193536,reflection's slow shadow steals down the gay hill,anapaestic,10
193537,though as yet you may shun the soft shade as you will,anapaestic,10
193538,and on hope fix your eye till the brightness so clear,anapaestic,10
193539,shall hang on its lid a dim trembling tear,anapaestic,10
193540,next the shades of mild evening close gently around,anapaestic,10
193541,and lengthen'd reflection must stalk o'er the ground,anapaestic,10
193542,through her lantern of magic past pleasures are seen,anapaestic,10
193543,and we then only know what our daydreams have been,anapaestic,10
193544,on the painted illusion we gaze while we can,anapaestic,10
193545,though we often exclaim what a bauble is man,anapaestic,10
193546,in youth but a gewgaw in age but a toy,anapaestic,10
193547,the same empty trifle as man and as boy,anapaestic,10
194166,what nature alas has denied,anapaestic,10
194167,to the delicate growth of our isle,anapaestic,10
194168,art has in a measure supplied,anapaestic,10
194169,and winter is deck'd with a smile,anapaestic,10
194170,see mary what beauties i bring,anapaestic,10
194171,from the shelter of that sunny shed,anapaestic,10
194172,where the flow'rs have the charms of the spring,anapaestic,10
194173,though abroad they are frozen and dead,anapaestic,10
194174,'tis a bow'r of arcadian sweets,anapaestic,10
194175,where flora is still in her prime,anapaestic,10
194176,a fortress to which she retreats,anapaestic,10
194177,from the cruel assaults of the clime,anapaestic,10
194178,while earth wears a mantle of snow,anapaestic,10
194179,these pinks are as fresh and as gay,anapaestic,10
194180,as the fairest and sweetest that blow,anapaestic,10
194181,on the beautiful bosom of may,anapaestic,10
194182,see how thcy have safely surviv'd,anapaestic,10
194183,the frowns of a sky so severe,anapaestic,10
194184,such mary's true love that has liv'd,anapaestic,10
194185,through many a turbulent year,anapaestic,10
194186,the charms of the late blowing rose,anapaestic,10
194187,seem grac'd with a livelier hue,anapaestic,10
194188,and the winter of sorrow best shows,anapaestic,10
194189,the truth of a friend such as you,anapaestic,10
194356,when the trees are all bare not a leaf to be seen,anapaestic,10
194357,and the meadows their beauty have lost,anapaestic,10
194358,when nature's disrob'd of her mantle of green,anapaestic,10
194359,and the streams are fast bound with the frost,anapaestic,10
194360,while the peasant inactive stands shivering with cold,anapaestic,10
194361,as bleak the winds northerly blow,anapaestic,10
194362,and the innocent flocks run for warmth to the fold,anapaestic,10
194363,with their fleeces besprinkled with snow,anapaestic,10
194364,in the yard when the cattle are fodder'd with straw,anapaestic,10
194365,and they send forth their breath like a steam,anapaestic,10
194366,and the neat looking dairymaid sees she must thaw,anapaestic,10
194367,flakes of ice that she finds in the cream,anapaestic,10
194368,when the sweet countrymaiden as fresh as a rose,anapaestic,10
194369,as she carelessly trips often slides,anapaestic,10
194370,and the rustics laugh loud if by falling she shews,anapaestic,10
194371,all the charms that her modesty hides,anapaestic,10
194372,when the lads and the lasses for company join'd,anapaestic,10
194373,in a croud round the embers are met,anapaestic,10
194374,talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind,anapaestic,10
194375,and of ghosts till they're all in a sweat,anapaestic,10
194376,heaven grant in this season it may be my lot,anapaestic,10
194377,with the nymph whom i love and admire,anapaestic,10
194378,while the icicles hang from the eves of my cot,anapaestic,10
194379,i may thither in safety retire,anapaestic,10
194380,where in neatness and quiet and free from surprize,anapaestic,10
194381,we may live and no hardships endure,anapaestic,10
194382,nor feel any turbulent passions arise,anapaestic,10
194383,but such as each other may cure,anapaestic,10
194448,should i e'er become parson for so i'm inclin'd,anapaestic,10
194449,may i get a snug benefice pat to my mind,anapaestic,10
194450,large enough to allow of a wife at my table,anapaestic,10
194451,a cow in my yard and a nag in my stable,anapaestic,10
194452,may my flock n'er embroil me in quarrels and strife,anapaestic,10
194453,in good humour i'd live all the days of my life,anapaestic,10
194454,and die before tir'd of myself or my wife,anapaestic,10
194455,with a friend or two near me of equal degree,anapaestic,10
194456,as like me in all things as pea is to pea,anapaestic,10
194457,on a pudding and joint who contented can dine,anapaestic,10
194458,with a glass of old port and october divine,anapaestic,10
194462,may my offerings and tythes make me always appear,anapaestic,10
194463,with a clean tho' coarse shirt ev'ry day in the year,anapaestic,10
194464,for of all living things not excepting a swine,anapaestic,10
194465,the beastliest of beasts is a beastly divine,anapaestic,10
194469,may i ne'er grow too grave not to join in the fun,anapaestic,10
194470,when my lord cracks a joke or the squire cuts a pun,anapaestic,10
194471,for if life is a jest as the wisest have spoke,anapaestic,10
194472,he lives the best life then who cuts the best joke,anapaestic,10
194476,with no mystical learning i'd trouble my head,anapaestic,10
194477,relying on faith which will do in its stead,anapaestic,10
194478,with knowledge enough heaven's gates to unlock,anapaestic,10
194479,and to take the strait road there along with my flock,anapaestic,10
194483,with a bottle or two of prime wine on my shelf,anapaestic,10
194484,to recur to whene'er i am tir'd of myself,anapaestic,10
194485,and a good natur'd muse to retire to at leisure,anapaestic,10
194486,who will wrap me in rhimes and inspire me with measure,anapaestic,10
194490,to enjoy what i have without wishing for more,anapaestic,10
194491,for contentment with little is doubling one's store,anapaestic,10
194492,and when i am gone may my successor say,anapaestic,10
194493,he's gone and i wish i could live the same way,anapaestic,10
194494,for his flock ne'er embroil'd him in quarrels or strife,anapaestic,10
194495,in good humour he liv'd all the days of his life,anapaestic,10
194496,and died before tir'd of himself or his wife,anapaestic,10
194527,all i ask of bounteous heav'n,trochaic,8
194528,in a cottage sweet retirement,trochaic,8
194529,far from town and all its vices,trochaic,8
194530,passing all my days serenely,trochaic,8
194531,far from ball and masquerade,trochaic,8
194532,far from courtly pomp and fashion,trochaic,8
194533,distant from the madding croud,trochaic,8
194534,quitting smoak for silver fountains,trochaic,8
194535,ease and comfort peace and plenty,trochaic,8
194536,every joy that can be wish'd for,trochaic,8
194537,with the lark each morn arising,trochaic,8
194538,but contentment sweet possessing,trochaic,8
194539,each new day my maker praising,trochaic,8
194540,thanking heav'n for ev'ry blessing,trochaic,8
194541,one thing more i ask of heaven,trochaic,8
194542,one whose heart is ever constant,trochaic,8
194543,blest with judgment sound and clear,trochaic,8
194544,not the clown or foolish coxcomb,trochaic,8
194545,gentle as the evening breezes,trochaic,8
194546,fresher than the summer morning,trochaic,8
194547,smart and witty mild in manners,trochaic,8
194548,free from flatt'ry pride and folly,trochaic,8
194549,i desire not pow'r or riches,trochaic,8
194550,they are not the joys i wish for,trochaic,8
195954,we of late had a terrible rout in our house,anapaestic,10
195955,if i happen'd to speak i was sure of a souse,anapaestic,10
195956,my mamma had the toothach and i felt the smart,anapaestic,10
195957,o steel i for ever will value thy art,anapaestic,10
195958,both children and servants to thee are beholden,anapaestic,10
195959,let them do what they would they were sure of a scolding,anapaestic,10
195960,athenians i humbly beseech you explain,anapaestic,10
195961,why the tongue cannot rest when the teeth are in pain,anapaestic,10
196987,the death song,anapaestic,10
196988,written for and adapted to an original indian air,anapaestic,10
196989,the sun sets in night and the stars shun the day,anapaestic,10
196990,but glory remains when their lights fade away,anapaestic,10
196991,begin you tormentors your threats are in vain,anapaestic,10
196992,for the son of alknomook will never complain,anapaestic,10
196993,remember the arrows he shot from his bow,anapaestic,10
196994,remember your chiefs by his hatchet laid low,anapaestic,10
196995,why so slow do you wait till i shrink from the pain,anapaestic,10
196996,no the son of alknomook shall never complain,anapaestic,10
196997,remember the wood where in ambush we lay,anapaestic,10
196998,and the scalps which we bore from your nation away,anapaestic,10
196999,now the flame rises fast you exult in my pain,anapaestic,10
197000,but the son of alknomook can never complain,anapaestic,10
197001,i go to the land where my father is gone,anapaestic,10
197002,his ghost shall rejoice in the fame of his son,anapaestic,10
197003,death comes like a friend to relieve me from pain,anapaestic,10
197004,and thy son o alknomook has scorn'd to complain,anapaestic,10
199158,come to me and put thine sweet eyes,anapaestic,10
199159,to put slander within my mind,anapaestic,10
199160,of the old and bad trite stale kind,anapaestic,10
199161,what false lines do impinge thy name,anapaestic,10
199162,the well known lord and lady blare,anapaestic,10
199163,such words i will not yea believe,anapaestic,10
199164,since without gens how they deceive,anapaestic,10
199165,the hot fire of this flames flambeau,anapaestic,10
199166,will burn scurrilous page i know,anapaestic,10
199167,then with glaive on this pole ill take,anapaestic,10
199168,their head clean off for they names sake,anapaestic,10
199169,i recall to our life when she came,anapaestic,10
199170,and for long years few knew who she was,anapaestic,10
199171,two decades and more still theres oerload,anapaestic,10
199172,of mega bits and bytes thrown to us,anapaestic,10
199173,and what a contradiction it is,anapaestic,10
199174,no one has refrained from sharing views,anapaestic,10
199175,and i oft feel ignorance is zen,anapaestic,10
199176,but today it might drown us in doubt,anapaestic,10
199177,time there was when it seemed our asset,anapaestic,10
199178,such is shy maidens felicity,anapaestic,10
199179,but mired with opinions dressed as lie,anapaestic,10
199180,so enchanted was sun by queen sea,anapaestic,10
199181,as he sat near some clouds high above,anapaestic,10
199182,he began sliding down stealthily,anapaestic,10
199183,till he touched the dark face of his love,anapaestic,10
199184,then a third lover looked on the face,anapaestic,10
199185,rosy heavens with deep purple lace,anapaestic,10
199186,night embraced lovely sea sun was gone,anapaestic,10
199187,such poor plight how can forever conceal,anapaestic,10
199188,who will write future in black and white,anapaestic,10
199189,this surveyed,anapaestic,10
199190,in solitude,anapaestic,10
199192,i must look very deep in my soul,anapaestic,10
199193,that will help me get close to my goal,anapaestic,10
199194,clear i see as a child i was free,anapaestic,10
199195,brought to church i was taught god to love,anapaestic,10
199196,down a path that would lead to above,anapaestic,10
199197,for my heart and my soul lived for god,anapaestic,10
199198,knowing he was my staff and my rod,anapaestic,10
199199,now my hate strongly started to burn,anapaestic,10
199200,all this hate in me screamed set me free,anapaestic,10
199201,i am saved by his grace every day,anapaestic,10
199202,im at peace and my spirit is free,anapaestic,10
199203,free to fly with these wings god gave me,anapaestic,10
199204,i will dread octobers spell,anapaestic,10
199205,it only comes but once a year,anapaestic,10
199206,but mummys cell phone gets a tweet,anapaestic,10
199207,she gets unraveled in the sheets,anapaestic,10
199208,and from the gauze that trips her feet,anapaestic,10
199209,ghouls in shadows want to play,anapaestic,10
199210,does he stand a ghost of chance,anapaestic,10
199211,to take her to the midnight dance,anapaestic,10
199212,our cat has groomed her black coat sleek,anapaestic,10
199213,then hops upon the fence to sneak,anapaestic,10
199214,a peek into the living room,anapaestic,10
199215,where dad weaves magic like a goon,anapaestic,10
199216,embarrassed is a family clan,anapaestic,10
199217,they toss his magic in the can,anapaestic,10
199218,a wartnosed witch gets on her broom,anapaestic,10
199219,but preteen feet cant fly or zoom,anapaestic,10
199220,until she cleans her messy room,anapaestic,10
199221,the bedrooms cleaned with spit and shine,anapaestic,10
199222,while brother dares to take his time,anapaestic,10
199223,he plans to fill his sisters bag,anapaestic,10
199224,with tasty toads and wormy slime,anapaestic,10
199225,i hide and dread the harvest moon,anapaestic,10
199226,all hollows eve is coming soon,anapaestic,10
199227,i thought id write some poetry,anapaestic,10
199228,just for the fun that it would be,anapaestic,10
199229,so i went to the web to see,anapaestic,10
199230,what it said,anapaestic,10
199231,about how to write poems just for me,anapaestic,10
199232,i ran into words like iambic and tercet,anapaestic,10
199233,and other ones that i had never met,anapaestic,10
199234,there was even a thing called a quatrain,anapaestic,10
199235,that confused and corrupted my brain,anapaestic,10
199236,stanzas are neat if they get the right beat,anapaestic,10
199237,with the meter which id no doubt delete,anapaestic,10
199238,you also have tetrameter and pentameter,anapaestic,10
199239,which are terms i dont think are neat,anapaestic,10
199240,long ago i did write in rhyme,anapaestic,10
199241,but just to friends who didnt mind,anapaestic,10
199242,id write some limericks or lyrics to sing,anapaestic,10
199243,that were not important,anapaestic,10
199244,and didnt mean a thing,anapaestic,10
199245,but as i write now and look into how,anapaestic,10
199246,i find myself stymied by words to allow,anapaestic,10
199247,i read such things as trochee,anapaestic,10
199248,and anapest and even dactyl,anapaestic,10
199249,they are words i just read,anapaestic,10
199250,and dont really feel,anapaestic,10
199251,a measure in feet,anapaestic,10
199252,with stresses on heavy or light,anapaestic,10
199253,and then they repeat,anapaestic,10
199254,they do form the meter,anapaestic,10
199255,which makes the poem complete,anapaestic,10
199256,i may just give up and write more in prose,anapaestic,10
199257,my friends will give thanks and id smell like a rose,anapaestic,10
199258,but i do get such joy with the lines in a verse,anapaestic,10
199259,which doesnt make sense,anapaestic,10
199260,and just makes it worse,anapaestic,10
199261,free verse would just boggle my mind,anapaestic,10
199262,it really wont matter,anapaestic,10
199263,what rules i would shatter,anapaestic,10
199264,as long as i make the words rhyme,anapaestic,10
199265,limerick gimmerick,anapaestic,10
199266,jason of pendleton,anapaestic,10
199267,tried doubledactyls while,anapaestic,10
199268,fearing the worst,anapaestic,10
199269,uhohspaghettio,anapaestic,10
199270,theyre all bassackwards cuz,anapaestic,10
199271,hes used to anapest,anapaestic,10
199272,an old goat in a boat rowed off shore,anapaestic,10
199273,he caught perch in his search and much more,anapaestic,10
199274,theres trout in his coat,anapaestic,10
199275,eau de fish was his scent evermore,anapaestic,10
199276,how they laugh and they point as they whisper bout me,anapaestic,10
199277,and they only can see what their shallow eyes see,anapaestic,10
199278,though my surface is not picture perfect for show,anapaestic,10
199279,how this heart bleeds with purpose they never could know,anapaestic,10
199280,of the horrors and trials my soul has survived,anapaestic,10
199281,of the hell and the fury that killed me alive,anapaestic,10
199282,ive been stripped of my honor and burnt at the stake,anapaestic,10
199283,made to live in a nightmare but could not awake,anapaestic,10
199284,the atrocities bared on my face in display,anapaestic,10
199285,oh they cause you to cringe as your eyes turn away,anapaestic,10
199286,and the truth is my scars are much deeper than face,anapaestic,10
199287,just a trace has been left of humanitys grace,anapaestic,10
199288,as they came in the dead of the night whilst we slept,anapaestic,10
199289,through the house down the hall they so silently crept,anapaestic,10
199290,i was tied to a chair and with sickened disgust,anapaestic,10
199291,made to watch as my daughters defiled with their lust,anapaestic,10
199292,oh my sweet baby girls who i failed to protect,anapaestic,10
199293,now your innocence lives in my heart where youre kept,anapaestic,10
199294,as the flames and your screams took the last of my peace,anapaestic,10
199295,melting skin joined my tears as your souls found release,anapaestic,10
199296,fall the leaves of the forest tho death has yet passed,anapaestic,10
199297,unto moonlit shadows within crypts hidden rot,anapaestic,10
199298,oh but lo to the truth they are blind it is naught,anapaestic,10
199299,theyre but fragmented feelings of love left aghast,anapaestic,10
199300,from her heart they were torn bits he stabbed then forgot,anapaestic,10
199301,the shadows cannot hide nor contain the scars wrought,anapaestic,10
199302,left to wander until retribution is brought,anapaestic,10
199303,as the sky bleeds to twilight the sweetest disease,anapaestic,10
199304,as a warm breeze courts eros at twilights advance,anapaestic,10
199305,till a feverish tango as all reason halts,anapaestic,10
199306,as the world falls from focus in dizzying strides,anapaestic,10
199307,should the moon cast its toxin on amorous souls,anapaestic,10
199308,the subject at hand will be somewhat informal,anapaestic,10
199309,i wonder each day what will be the new normal,anapaestic,10
199310,to find some brand new locks growing out of my ear,anapaestic,10
199311,and what of tomorrow morning when i awake,anapaestic,10
199312,will i find a limb afflicted with a strange ache,anapaestic,10
199313,will the pharmacy have some great cream or a pill,anapaestic,10
199314,to assuage sudden change brought on by my ill,anapaestic,10
199315,i have chosen to find humor rather than stress,anapaestic,10
199316,to keep our lives routine will cost us more money,anapaestic,10
199317,to the edge of horizons and harmonys light,anapaestic,10
199318,comes warm smiles to be found on the face of our hearts,anapaestic,10
199319,this rapture so vibrant from the wealth of loves eyes,anapaestic,10
199320,was released and was felt when we cut through its veils,anapaestic,10
199321,to invite a new world to be filled with lifes needs,anapaestic,10
199322,and claim peace from the soul with the years to be shared,anapaestic,10
199323,to welcome the mornings when the light rushes free,anapaestic,10
199324,and hinges on eyelids come open to adore,anapaestic,10
199325,the lovely jewels held in the life well treasure,anapaestic,10
199326,as we move through the days with a blissful intent,anapaestic,10
199327,when time becomes fleeting and the days become nights,anapaestic,10
199328,unaware of the world and the time to have passed,anapaestic,10
199329,to spend our emotions when love found us worthy,anapaestic,10
199330,this payment to be made with the lips breathless kiss,anapaestic,10
199331,i was lost as the night wrapped its ebony shades,anapaestic,10
199332,round your lips like the petals on roses unfurled,anapaestic,10
199333,left me hopeless to shun a temptation like this,anapaestic,10
199334,though aware of the thorns and the danger they posed,anapaestic,10
199335,so i reached for your love and i bled and i cried,anapaestic,10
199336,as i danced through the stems of your past and your life,anapaestic,10
199337,and was freed from my own hidden garden of pain,anapaestic,10
199338,a poet was making such clatter,anapaestic,10
199339,his friend ran to see whats the matter,anapaestic,10
199340,or my poems cant be,anapaestic,10
199341,in antiseptic pentameter,anapaestic,10
199342,his friend laughed at all of the chatter,anapaestic,10
199343,the other didnt grasp the matter,anapaestic,10
199344,so your poems will be,anapaestic,10
199345,in antipasto pentameter,anapaestic,10
199346,my problem with glutens the matter,anapaestic,10
199347,and why i must make so much clatter,anapaestic,10
199348,im allergic you see,anapaestic,10
199349,id get shakes and would be,anapaestic,10
199350,writing in spastic pentameter,anapaestic,10
199351,in a prayer anapestic,anapaestic,10
199352,this form was to tick,anapaestic,10
199353,tis the day after christmas the house is a mess,anapaestic,10
199354,when will they restore order thats anyones guess,anapaestic,10
199355,this familys sluggish and tired as can be,anapaestic,10
199356,seven veggies mom will use her skills to disguise,anapaestic,10
199357,all thats left shell transform it and serve it for days,anapaestic,10
199358,daddy slips to the den to his favorite chair,anapaestic,10
199359,for a short winters napthen sees mom standing there,anapaestic,10
199360,then a big pile of invoices for us awaits,anapaestic,10
199361,we will pay them online now is no time to doze,anapaestic,10
199362,then up from the recliner poor pooped dad arose,anapaestic,10
199363,i can see them but often are blurs undefined,anapaestic,10
199364,i can see them in beauty of lifes sweet ballet,anapaestic,10
199365,every new day unfolds with its bright morning ray,anapaestic,10
199366,in their river of insights where artistry streams,anapaestic,10
199367,inspiration flows from them in glorious beams,anapaestic,10
199368,gods most beautiful creatures of angels help me,anapaestic,10
199369,angel love and directionsunup till sundown,anapaestic,10
199371,i cannot say how poems come to be,anapaestic,10
199372,they come into my mind amazingly,anapaestic,10
199373,i cannot say how i hunt down my words,anapaestic,10
199374,or then select a form to fit the theme,anapaestic,10
199375,or count the syllables for metered flow,anapaestic,10
199376,select the feet of two or more to show,anapaestic,10
199377,that make the words behave or wildly prance,anapaestic,10
199378,to then rewrite and add what i forgot,anapaestic,10
199381,is an awesome reserve of a pot filled with gold,anapaestic,10
199382,in the form of gold coins to use up selfishly,anapaestic,10
199383,theyll be wishes come true deep within to allot,anapaestic,10
199384,like a resolute peace in each country on earth,anapaestic,10
199385,find the cure for diseasestheir mysteries solved,anapaestic,10
199386,so the curse of these monsters is truly dissolved,anapaestic,10
199387,find a way to stop hunger both here and abroad,anapaestic,10
199388,make new laws so that violence does not erupt,anapaestic,10
199389,with her laws keep in sync in whatever we do,anapaestic,10
199390,theyll be wishes come true for mankind to behold,anapaestic,10
199391,the first child with a brother who followed in time,anapaestic,10
199392,and my teachers took time to encourage my urge,anapaestic,10
199393,i enjoyed my young years while i painted and penned,anapaestic,10
199394,lots of canvas and paper used up without end,anapaestic,10
199395,and enjoyed my new path of becoming a wife,anapaestic,10
199396,we worked hard every day and our life was so good,anapaestic,10
199397,i wrote poems and painted whenever i could,anapaestic,10
199398,and i studied six years at an art gallery,anapaestic,10
199399,i enrolled in a college to study parttime,anapaestic,10
199400,a baand a minor in business for me,anapaestic,10
199401,and i soon published poems of life and of heart,anapaestic,10
199402,yet along in this time of my great writing spree,anapaestic,10
199403,i worked hard every day as our business vp,anapaestic,10
199404,our dear children all married with families too,anapaestic,10
199405,are involved happily in whatever they do,anapaestic,10
199406,and one granddaughter married two thousand thirteen,anapaestic,10
199407,we are proud and so blessed and thank god up above,anapaestic,10
199408,for our days and our life of good times filled with love,anapaestic,10
199409,but to my big surprise when that contest was done,anapaestic,10
199410,my sad eyes saw in fact that my poem had not won,anapaestic,10
199411,could not find what it meant anywhere on the site,anapaestic,10
199412,my head spun to fit in which of these it could be,anapaestic,10
199413,now i still do not know what na represents,anapaestic,10
199414,when your poem doesnt win in soup contest events,anapaestic,10
199415,i give praise and respect to the christ,anapaestic,10
199416,his good grace as i ask is a win,anapaestic,10
199417,in no way does no price mean no cost,anapaestic,10
199418,for gods mercys a gift he presents,anapaestic,10
199419,for eternity wasted expense,anapaestic,10
199420,the real cost for our lord was his blood,anapaestic,10
199421,and our god sends his spirit to flood,anapaestic,10
199422,the new life with the powr of the cross,anapaestic,10
199423,sins a breach between man and his god,anapaestic,10
199424,he deserves no mere shallow embrace,anapaestic,10
199425,no believer with simply a nod,anapaestic,10
199426,understands the full cost of his grace,anapaestic,10
199427,does a friendship with god eer begin,anapaestic,10
199428,jesus christ wants obedience now,anapaestic,10
199429,than to lay down your life for your friend,anapaestic,10
199430,we set off on excursions within that domain,anapaestic,10
199431,we began at a loss,anapaestic,10
199432,we embark on a most unpredictable task,anapaestic,10
199433,touring cadillac mountain with fog as a mask,anapaestic,10
199434,by creating a fuss,anapaestic,10
199435,up the fiftytwo steps to attend to our need,anapaestic,10
199436,we by chance run across,anapaestic,10
199437,is it algae or lichen a fungus or fern,anapaestic,10
199438,a true whatzit for us,anapaestic,10
199439,i see fanciful lace mid inherent decay,anapaestic,10
199440,i see whimsical bubbles entangled in play,anapaestic,10
199441,i see change as our mood now reverses dismay,anapaestic,10
199442,its an insight from moss,anapaestic,10
199443,in a small grassy field,anapaestic,10
199444,with the trees all around,anapaestic,10
199445,theres a fairy ring ancient and old,anapaestic,10
199446,and at times you can hear,anapaestic,10
199447,perfect echoes of sound,anapaestic,10
199448,tis the music of ages untold,anapaestic,10
199449,for the crickets keep time,anapaestic,10
199450,to a waltz or a reel,anapaestic,10
199451,and the birds fill that lovely expanse,anapaestic,10
199452,with the notes to a tune,anapaestic,10
199453,in the field where the butterflies dance,anapaestic,10
199454,where the wildflowers bloom,anapaestic,10
199455,with a sweet perfume,anapaestic,10
199456,in a rainbow of colours and shades,anapaestic,10
199457,where the maids hurry down,anapaestic,10
199458,from the hilltop town,anapaestic,10
199459,and the butterflies dance with the maids,anapaestic,10
199460,on a winged pirouette,anapaestic,10
199461,or a six legged slip,anapaestic,10
199462,and their wings flash in time,anapaestic,10
199463,to a bright scottish trip,anapaestic,10
199464,while the lassies turn round by the burn,anapaestic,10
199475,where they splash in the stream,anapaestic,10
199476,or they lie and dream,anapaestic,10
199477,where the bullfrogs thrum,anapaestic,10
199478,while the butterflies wing,anapaestic,10
199479,and the hummingbirds hum,anapaestic,10
199480,while the merry maids sing,anapaestic,10
199481,dawn chorus trills arias in duet,anapaestic,10
199482,not a dulcet tone morning to forget,anapaestic,10
199483,rose shot with purl,anapaestic,10
199484,a white wedding dress shimmers in sunlight,anapaestic,10
199485,rose petals curl,anapaestic,10
199486,the fresh flush of a virgin prescribed writ,anapaestic,10
199487,the purity evident on soffit,anapaestic,10
199488,rose throws to hurl,anapaestic,10
199489,the serene still reflection in mirror,anapaestic,10
199490,belie fervid brow tester an error,anapaestic,10
199491,rose bud unfurls,anapaestic,10
199492,the first time i heard this i was in disbelief,anapaestic,10
199493,as he readied to play he rosined a long bow,anapaestic,10
199494,on a hill far away the notes softly and slow,anapaestic,10
199495,i heard voices of angels in tune through it all,anapaestic,10
199496,through it all the strange notes woefully made demand,anapaestic,10
199497,with small pricks of conscience from the musics tearful darts,anapaestic,10
199498,with such lightness and patterns and passionfilled phrases,anapaestic,10
199499,do you deign to reply just to prop up your selfpride,anapaestic,10
199500,and takes pride in the craft of his new devotee,anapaestic,10
199501,magnanimity faded as rivalries grew,anapaestic,10
199502,with the confidence born of a spirit secure,anapaestic,10
199503,many veteran artists opine to be sure,anapaestic,10
199504,and the metrical rhythm and pacing they find,anapaestic,10
199505,so essential to verse in traditional form,anapaestic,10
199506,with the internal metronome setting the norm,anapaestic,10
199507,and the imagery seen in a free verse unbound,anapaestic,10
199508,by the strictures and structures of metrical scheme,anapaestic,10
199509,nontraditional verse deserves no less esteem,anapaestic,10
199510,in the end all agree that emotions the key,anapaestic,10
199511,and the soul of the poet must yearn to be free,anapaestic,10
199512,be the uncensored voice that will sometimes annoy,anapaestic,10
199513,theres a river that twists in the mind,anapaestic,10
199514,on crusades to the summit of rhyme,anapaestic,10
199515,where my phoenix of tropes and schemes live,anapaestic,10
199516,in a war to free dictions fair queen,anapaestic,10
199517,where the soldiers of babel bemuse,anapaestic,10
199518,and the modern day graceless regimes,anapaestic,10
199519,are in battles to stifle my muse,anapaestic,10
199520,in my quest for her verse of prestige,anapaestic,10
199521,i have traveled a nexus of words,anapaestic,10
199522,with this lexis of language on siege,anapaestic,10
199523,where the dissonant hum drum is heard,anapaestic,10
199524,as i pin down my thoughts in a rush,anapaestic,10
199525,as her essence of glory i brush,anapaestic,10
199526,shes the queen muse that whispers within,anapaestic,10
199527,she supplies me the yarn that i spin,anapaestic,10
199528,as she lends me her rhythm awhile,anapaestic,10
199529,its the moment her highness is freed,anapaestic,10
199530,that the armies of dissonance fall,anapaestic,10
199531,and the sound of perfection can bleed,anapaestic,10
199532,in those lyrical sounds that enthrall,anapaestic,10
199533,i was born bronx new york in the year 'thirty nine,anapaestic,10

199640,fifteen hundred feet high and sh shaking we ask,anapaestic,10
199641,with alarm where's the bus,anapaestic,10
199642,safely back at sea level we all need to chill,anapaestic,10
199643,tell me who put the rest stop on top of a hill,anapaestic,10
199644,giving vent to our steam we release it with skill,anapaestic,10
199646,so we cuss as we scurry we snort and stampede,anapaestic,10
199647,up the fifty two steps to attend to our need,anapaestic,10
199648,on the zig zag descent rather tetchy still teed,anapaestic,10
199650,a botanical gem symbiotic we learn,anapaestic,10

199663,about me and my writing how fluid i am',anapaestic,10
199664,or perhaps you're a mentor by nature and offer,anapaestic,10

199689,not a creature was stirring not even a mouse,anapaestic,10
199690,the stockings were hung by the chimney with care,anapaestic,10
199691,in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there,anapaestic,10
199692,the children were nestled all snug in their beds,anapaestic,10
199693,while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,anapaestic,10
199694,nd mamma in her 'kerchief and i in my cap,anapaestic,10
199695,had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,anapaestic,10
199696,when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,anapaestic,10
199697,sprang from the bed to see what was the matter,anapaestic,10
199698,away to the window i flew like a flash,anapaestic,10
199699,tore open the shutters and threw up the sash,anapaestic,10
199700,the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow,anapaestic,10
199701,gave the lustre of mid day to objects below,anapaestic,10
199702,when what to my wondering eyes should appear,anapaestic,10
199703,but a miniature sleigh and eight tinny reindeer,anapaestic,10
199704,with a little old driver so lively and quick,anapaestic,10
199705,i knew in a moment it must be st nick,anapaestic,10
199706,more rapid than eagles his coursers they came,anapaestic,10
199707,and he whistled and shouted and called them by name,anapaestic,10
199708,now dasher now dancer now prancer and vixen,anapaestic,10
199709,on comet on cupid on on donner and blitzen,anapaestic,10
199710,to the top of the porch to the top of the wall,anapaestic,10
199711,now dash away dash away dash away all,anapaestic,10
199712,as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,anapaestic,10
199713,when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky,anapaestic,10
199714,so up to the house top the coursers they flew,anapaestic,10
199715,with the sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too,anapaestic,10
199716,and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof,anapaestic,10
199717,the prancing and pawing of each little hoof,anapaestic,10
199718,as i drew in my head and was turning around,anapaestic,10
199719,down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound,anapaestic,10
199720,he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,anapaestic,10
199721,and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot,anapaestic,10
199722,a bundle of toys he had flung on his back,anapaestic,10
199723,and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack,anapaestic,10
199724,his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry,anapaestic,10
199725,his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry,anapaestic,10
199726,his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,anapaestic,10
199727,and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow,anapaestic,10
199728,the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,anapaestic,10
199729,and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath,anapaestic,10
199730,he had a broad face and a little round belly,anapaestic,10
199731,that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly,anapaestic,10
199732,he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf,anapaestic,10
199733,and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself,anapaestic,10
199734,a wink of his eye and a twist of his head,anapaestic,10
199735,soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread,anapaestic,10
199736,he spoke not a word but went straight to his work,anapaestic,10
199737,and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk,anapaestic,10
199738,and laying his finger aside of his nose,anapaestic,10
199739,and giving a nod up the chimney he rose,anapaestic,10
199740,he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle,anapaestic,10
199741,and away they all flew like the down of a thistle,anapaestic,10
199742,but i heard him exclaim 'ere he drove out of sight,anapaestic,10
199743,happy christmas to all and to all a good night,anapaestic,10
199744,when the sparklers have sparked and the cannons have boomed,anapaestic,10
199745,and the flags have been flown and the flowers have bloomed,anapaestic,10
199746,when the coleslaw arrives and the meat has been grilled,anapaestic,10
199747,and the children have played and the bellies are filled,anapaestic,10
199748,when the families have left after long fond good byes,anapaestic,10
199749,and the tables are cleared we sit back with a sigh,anapaestic,10
199750,then we doze and digest with a satisfied smile,anapaestic,10
199751,and with fondness remember the day for awhile,anapaestic,10
199752,but perhaps in the midst of the party and fun,anapaestic,10
199753,we've lost sight of the way that our freedom was won,anapaestic,10
199754,let us never forget the great war that was fought,anapaestic,10
199755,and the price for our freedom in blood dearly bought,anapaestic,10
199756,for the wisest of men said that truth sets you free,anapaestic,10
199757,and to let freedom ring truth was nailed to a tree,anapaestic,10
199758,now that i tying thy glass mask tightly,anapaestic,10
199759,may gaze thro' these faint smokes curling whitely,anapaestic,10
199760,as thou pliest thy trade in this devil's smithy,anapaestic,10
199761,which is the poison to poison her prithee,anapaestic,10
199762,he is with her and they know that i know,anapaestic,10
199763,where they are what they do they believe my tears flow,anapaestic,10
199764,while they laugh laugh at me at me fled to the drear,anapaestic,10
199765,empty church to pray god in for them i am here,anapaestic,10
199766,grind away moisten and mash up thy paste,anapaestic,10
199767,pound at thy powder i am not in haste,anapaestic,10
199768,better sit thus and observe thy strange things,anapaestic,10
199769,than go where men wait me and dance at the king's,anapaestic,10
199770,that in the mortar you call it a gum,anapaestic,10
199771,ah the brave tree whence such gold oozings come,anapaestic,10
199772,and yonder soft phial the exquisite blue,anapaestic,10
199773,sure to taste sweetly is that poison too,anapaestic,10
199774,had i but all of them thee and thy treasures,anapaestic,10
199775,what a wild crowd of invisible pleasures,anapaestic,10
199776,to carry pure death in an earring a casket,anapaestic,10
199777,a signet a fan mount a filigree basket,anapaestic,10
199778,soon at the king's a mere lozenge to give,anapaestic,10
199779,and pauline should have just thirty minutes to live,anapaestic,10
199780,but to light a pastile and elise with her head,anapaestic,10
199781,and her breast and her arms and her hands should drop dead,anapaestic,10
199782,quick is it finished the colour's too grim,anapaestic,10
199783,why not soft like the phial's enticing and dim,anapaestic,10
199784,let it brighten her drink let her turn it and stir,anapaestic,10
199785,and try it and taste ere she fix and prefer,anapaestic,10
199786,what a drop she's not little no minion like me,anapaestic,10
199787,that's why she ensnared him this never will free,anapaestic,10
199788,the soul from those masculine eyes say no,anapaestic,10
199789,to that pulse's magnificent come and go,anapaestic,10
199790,for only last night as they whispered i brought,anapaestic,10
199791,my own eyes to bear on her so that i thought,anapaestic,10
199792,could i keep them one half minute fixed she would fall,anapaestic,10
199793,shrivelled she fell not yet this does it all,anapaestic,10
199794,not that i bid you spare her the pain,anapaestic,10
199795,let death be felt and the proof remain,anapaestic,10
199796,brand burn up bite into its grace,anapaestic,10
199797,he is sure to remember her dying face,anapaestic,10
199798,is it done take my mask off nay be not morose,anapaestic,10
199799,it kills her and this prevents seeing it close,anapaestic,10
199800,the delicate droplet my whole fortune's fee,anapaestic,10
199801,if it hurts her beside can it ever hurt me,anapaestic,10
199802,now take all my jewels gorge gold to your fill,anapaestic,10
199803,you may kiss me old man on my mouth if you will,anapaestic,10
199804,but brush this dust off me lest horror it brings,anapaestic,10
199805,ere i know it next moment i dance at the king's,anapaestic,10
199806,listen my children and you shall hear,anapaestic,10
199807,of the midnight ride of paul revere,anapaestic,10
199808,on the eighteenth of april in seventy five,anapaestic,10
199809,hardly a man is now alive,anapaestic,10
199810,who remembers that famous day and year,anapaestic,10
199811,he said to his friend 'if the british march,anapaestic,10
199812,by land or sea from the town to night,anapaestic,10
199813,hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch,anapaestic,10
199814,of the north church tower as a signal light,anapaestic,10
199815,one if by land and two if by sea,anapaestic,10
199816,and i on the opposite shore will be,anapaestic,10
199817,ready to ride and spread the alarm,anapaestic,10
199818,through every middlesex village and farm,anapaestic,10
199819,for the country folk to be up and to arm',anapaestic,10
199820,then he said 'good night' and with muffled oar,anapaestic,10
199821,silently rowed to the charlestown shore,anapaestic,10
199822,just as the moon rose over the bay,anapaestic,10
199823,where swinging wide at her moorings lay,anapaestic,10
199824,the somerset british man of war,anapaestic,10
199825,a phantom ship with each mast and spar,anapaestic,10
199826,across the moon like a prison bar,anapaestic,10
199827,and a huge black hulk that was magnified,anapaestic,10
199828,by its own reflection in the tide,anapaestic,10
199829,meanwhile his friend through alley and street,anapaestic,10
199830,wanders and watches with eager ears,anapaestic,10
199831,till in the silence around him he hears,anapaestic,10
199832,the muster of men at the barrack door,anapaestic,10
199833,the sound of arms and the tramp of feet,anapaestic,10
199834,and the measured tread of the grenadiers,anapaestic,10
199835,marching down to their boats on the shore,anapaestic,10
199836,then he climbed the tower of the old north church,anapaestic,10
199837,by the wooden stairs with stealthy tread,anapaestic,10
199838,to the belfry chamber overhead,anapaestic,10
199839,and startled the pigeons from their perch,anapaestic,10
199840,on the sombre rafters that round him made,anapaestic,10
199841,masses and moving shapes of shade,anapaestic,10
199842,by the trembling ladder steep and tall,anapaestic,10
199843,to the highest window in the wall,anapaestic,10
199844,where he paused to listen and look down,anapaestic,10
199845,a moment on the roofs of the town,anapaestic,10
199846,and the moonlight flowing over all,anapaestic,10
199847,beneath in the churchyard lay the dead,anapaestic,10
199848,in their night encampment on the hill,anapaestic,10
199849,wrapped in silence so deep and still,anapaestic,10
199850,that he could hear like a sentinel's tread,anapaestic,10
199851,the watchful night wind as it went,anapaestic,10
199852,creeping along from tent to tent,anapaestic,10
199853,and seeming to whisper 'all is well',anapaestic,10
199854,a moment only he feels the spell,anapaestic,10
199855,of the place and the hour and the secret dread,anapaestic,10
199856,of the lonely belfry and the dead,anapaestic,10
199857,for suddenly all his thoughts are bent,anapaestic,10
199858,on a shadowy something far away,anapaestic,10
199859,where the river widens to meet the bay,anapaestic,10
199860,a line of black that bends and floats,anapaestic,10
199861,on the rising tide like a bridge of boats,anapaestic,10
199862,meanwhile impatient to mount and ride,anapaestic,10
199863,booted and spurred with a heavy stride,anapaestic,10
199864,on the opposite shore walked paul revere,anapaestic,10
199865,now he patted his horse's side,anapaestic,10
199866,now gazed at the landscape far and near,anapaestic,10
199867,then impetuous stamped the earth,anapaestic,10
199868,and turned and tightened his saddle girth,anapaestic,10
199869,but mostly he watched with eager search,anapaestic,10
199870,the belfry tower of the old north church,anapaestic,10
199871,as it rose above the graves on the hill,anapaestic,10
199872,lonely and spectral and sombre and still,anapaestic,10
199873,and lo as he looks on the belfry's height,anapaestic,10
199874,a glimmer and then a gleam of light,anapaestic,10
199875,he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns,anapaestic,10
199876,but lingers and gazes till full on his sight,anapaestic,10
199877,a second lamp in the belfry burns,anapaestic,10
199878,a hurry of hoofs in a village street,anapaestic,10
199879,a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark,anapaestic,10
199880,and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark,anapaestic,10
199881,struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet,anapaestic,10
199882,that was all and yet through the gloom and the light,anapaestic,10
199883,the fate of a nation was riding that night,anapaestic,10
199884,and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight,anapaestic,10
199885,kindled the land into flame with its heat,anapaestic,10
199886,he has left the village and mounted the steep,anapaestic,10
199887,and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep,anapaestic,10
199888,is the mystic meeting the ocean tides,anapaestic,10
199889,and under the alders that skirt its edge,anapaestic,10
199890,now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge,anapaestic,10
199891,is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides,anapaestic,10
199978,it was twelve by the village clock,anapaestic,10
199979,when he crossed the bridge into medford town,anapaestic,10
199980,he heard the crowing of the cock,anapaestic,10
199981,and the barking of the farmer's dog,anapaestic,10
199982,and felt the damp of the river fog,anapaestic,10
199983,that rises after the sun goes down,anapaestic,10
199984,it was one by the village clock,anapaestic,10
199985,when he galloped into lexington,anapaestic,10
199986,he saw the gilded weathercock,anapaestic,10
199987,swim in the moonlight as he passed,anapaestic,10
199988,and the meeting house windows blank and bare,anapaestic,10
199989,gaze at him with a spectral glare,anapaestic,10
199990,as if they already stood aghast,anapaestic,10
199991,at the bloody work they would look upon,anapaestic,10
199992,it was two by the village clock,anapaestic,10
199993,when he came to the bridge in concord town,anapaestic,10
199994,he heard the bleating of the flock,anapaestic,10
199995,and the twitter of birds among the trees,anapaestic,10
199996,and felt the breath of the morning breeze,anapaestic,10
199997,blowing over the meadows brown,anapaestic,10
199998,and one was safe and asleep in his bed,anapaestic,10
199999,who at the bridge would be first to fall,anapaestic,10
200000,who that day would be lying dead,anapaestic,10
200001,pierced by a british musket ball,anapaestic,10
200002,you know the rest in the books you have read,anapaestic,10
200003,how the british regulars fired and fled,anapaestic,10
200004,how the farmers gave them ball for ball,anapaestic,10
200005,from behind each fence and farm yard wall,anapaestic,10
200006,chasing the red coats down the lane,anapaestic,10
200007,then crossing the fields to emerge again,anapaestic,10
200008,under the trees at the turn of the road,anapaestic,10
200009,and only pausing to fire and load,anapaestic,10
200010,so through the night rode paul revere,anapaestic,10
200011,and so through the night went his cry of alarm,anapaestic,10
200012,to every middlesex village and farm,anapaestic,10
200013,a cry of defiance and not of fear,anapaestic,10
200014,a voice in the darkness a knock at the door,anapaestic,10
200015,and a word that shall echo forevermore,anapaestic,10
200016,for borne on the night wind of the past,anapaestic,10
200017,through all our history to the last,anapaestic,10
200018,in the hour of darkness and peril and need,anapaestic,10
200019,the people will waken and listen to hear,anapaestic,10
200020,the hurrying hoof beats of that steed,anapaestic,10
200021,and the midnight message of paul revere,anapaestic,10
200022,does it matter losing your legs,anapaestic,10
200023,for people will always be kind,anapaestic,10
200024,and you need not show that you mind,anapaestic,10
200025,to gobble their muffins and eggs,anapaestic,10
200026,does it matter losing your sight,anapaestic,10
200027,there's such splendid work for the blind,anapaestic,10
200028,and people will always be kind,anapaestic,10
200029,as you sit on the terrace remembering,anapaestic,10
200030,and turning your face to the light,anapaestic,10
200031,do they matter those dreams from the pit,anapaestic,10
200032,you can drink and forget and be glad,anapaestic,10
200033,and people won't say that you're mad,anapaestic,10
200034,for they'll know you've fought for your country,anapaestic,10
200035,and no one will worry a bit,anapaestic,10
200036,o rose thou art sick,anapaestic,10
200037,the invisible worm,anapaestic,10
200038,that flies in the night,anapaestic,10
200039,in the howling storm,anapaestic,10
200040,has found out thy bed,anapaestic,10
200041,of crimson joy,anapaestic,10
200042,and his dark secret love,anapaestic,10
200043,does thy life destroy,anapaestic,10
200044,the assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,anapaestic,10
200045,and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold,anapaestic,10
200046,and the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,anapaestic,10
200047,when the blue wave rolls nightly on deep galilee,anapaestic,10
200048,like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,anapaestic,10
200049,that host with their banners at sunset were seen,anapaestic,10
200050,like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,anapaestic,10
200051,that host on the morrow lay withered and strown,anapaestic,10
200052,for the angel of death spread his wings on the blast,anapaestic,10
200053,and breathed in the face of the foe as he passed,anapaestic,10
200054,and the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,anapaestic,10
200055,and their hearts but once heaved and for ever grew still,anapaestic,10
200056,and there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,anapaestic,10
200057,but through it there rolled not the breath of his pride,anapaestic,10
200058,and the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,anapaestic,10
200059,and cold as the spray of the rock beating surf,anapaestic,10
200060,and there lay the rider distorted and pale,anapaestic,10
200061,with the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail,anapaestic,10
200062,and the tents were all silent the banners alone,anapaestic,10
200063,the lances unlifted the trumpet unblown,anapaestic,10
200064,autumn is wearing her bright golden crown,anapaestic,10
200065,for this morning shes coming to visit our town,anapaestic,10
200066,and wind her best friend will be joining her too,anapaestic,10
200067,will they have a nice day and just what will they do,anapaestic,10
200068,shell be changing the colours of leaves on our trees,anapaestic,10
200069,and wind likes to tease with his cold playful breeze,anapaestic,10
200070,as the leaves tumble down in a pile on the ground,anapaestic,10
200071,he will take a deep breath and blow them around,anapaestic,10
200072,they'll both knock down conkers for children to find,anapaestic,10
200073,but the nuts arent just there for the good of mankind,anapaestic,10
200074,the squirrels like nuts and theyll store them away,anapaestic,10
200075,but then out they will come on those cold wintry days,anapaestic,10
200076,so what do you think that the two friends might eat,anapaestic,10
200077,what sorts of things would be good for a treat,anapaestic,10
200078,there are sweet tasting berries and fruits of all kinds,anapaestic,10
200079,which are wonderful treats for the two friends to find,anapaestic,10
200080,they will chase over hills and along by the river,anapaestic,10
200081,winds cold wintry breath may well cause us to shiver,anapaestic,10
200082,the swallows will see them and say their goodbye,anapaestic,10
200083,calling see you next year as they fly through the sky,anapaestic,10
200084,with the sun going down theres no time left to play,anapaestic,10
200085,but the two friends have had such a marvellous day,anapaestic,10
200086,when you look all around at this colourful scene,anapaestic,10
200087,you will see very clearly where these friends have been,anapaestic,10
200088,the tiger stretches limb by limb,anapaestic,10
200089,he views his world through sleepy eyes,anapaestic,10
200090,and wonders what his day will bring,anapaestic,10
200091,he does these things and so do i,anapaestic,10
200092,the bear sets forth to hunt for food,anapaestic,10
200093,and rambles under cloudy skies,anapaestic,10
200094,he ponders what hell eat today,anapaestic,10
200095,he looks for food and so do i,anapaestic,10
200096,all creatures teach their young to hunt,anapaestic,10
200097,and watch for danger lest they die,anapaestic,10
200098,the parents teach the skills of life,anapaestic,10
200099,their young learn these and so do i,anapaestic,10
200100,the creatures of the day will seek,anapaestic,10
200101,a place to sleep thats warm and dry,anapaestic,10
200102,a safe abode thats far from harm,anapaestic,10
200103,they drift to sleep and so do i,anapaestic,10
200104,the bull in the meadow was bellowing hard,anapaestic,10
200105,with a bawling and blustering blare,anapaestic,10
200106,but the cows thought the bull was just showing off,anapaestic,10
200107,and continued to graze without care,anapaestic,10
200108,his shouting his screaming his clamorous cry,anapaestic,10
200109,continued by day and by night,anapaestic,10
200110,his vociferous roaring soon got on their nerves,anapaestic,10
200111,whilst the mice and the birds fled in fright,anapaestic,10
200112,the farmer then noticed the terrible noise,anapaestic,10
200113,and he called in the vet to the scene,anapaestic,10
200114,the vet scratched his head and only could say,anapaestic,10
200115,its the noisiest bull that ive seen,anapaestic,10
200116,i remember he lived at the farm up the road,anapaestic,10
200117,and he had a particular friend,anapaestic,10
200118,i suggest that you buy her to go with your herd,anapaestic,10
200119,and im sure that his roaring will end,anapaestic,10

200183,stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms,dactyl,6
200184,darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven,dactyl,6
200185,speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest,dactyl,6
200186,this is the forest primeval but where are the hearts that beneath it,dactyl,6
200187,leaped like the roe when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman,dactyl,6
200188,where is the thatch roofed village the home of acadian farmers,dactyl,6
200189,men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,dactyl,6

200199,in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas,dactyl,6
200200,distant secluded still the little village of grand pr,dactyl,6
200201,lay in the fruitful valley vast meadows stretched to the eastward,dactyl,6
200202,giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number,dactyl,6
200203,dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,dactyl,6
200204,shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the flood gates,dactyl,6
200205,opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows,dactyl,6
200206,west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields,dactyl,6
200207,spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain and away to the northward,dactyl,6
200208,blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains,dactyl,6
200209,sea fogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic,dactyl,6
200210,looked on the happy valley but ne'er from their station descended,dactyl,6
200211,there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village,dactyl,6
200212,strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of hemlock,dactyl,6
200213,such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries,dactyl,6
200214,thatched were the roofs with dormer windows and gables projecting,dactyl,6
200215,over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway,dactyl,6
200216,there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset,dactyl,6
200217,lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,dactyl,6
200218,matrons and maidens sat in snow white caps and in kirtles,dactyl,6
200219,scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden,dactyl,6
200220,flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors,dactyl,6
200221,mingled their sounds with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens,dactyl,6
200222,solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children,dactyl,6
200223,paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them,dactyl,6
200224,reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens,dactyl,6
200225,hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome,dactyl,6
200226,then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank,dactyl,6
200227,down to his rest and twilight prevailed anon from the belfry,dactyl,6
200228,softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village,dactyl,6
200229,columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending,dactyl,6
200230,rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment,dactyl,6
200231,thus dwelt together in love these simple acadian farmers,dactyl,6
200232,dwelt in the love of god and of man alike were they free from,dactyl,6
200233,fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics,dactyl,6
200234,neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows,dactyl,6
200235,but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners,dactyl,6
200236,there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance,dactyl,6
200237,somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas,dactyl,6
200238,benedict bellefontaine the wealthiest farmer of grand pr,dactyl,6
200239,dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household,dactyl,6

200241,stalwart and stately in form was the man of seventy winters,dactyl,6
200242,hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes,dactyl,6
200243,white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oak leaves,dactyl,6
200244,fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers,dactyl,6
200245,black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,dactyl,6
200246,black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses,dactyl,6
200247,sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows,dactyl,6
200248,when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide,dactyl,6
200249,flagons of home brewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden,dactyl,6
200250,fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret,dactyl,6
200251,sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop,dactyl,6
200252,sprinkles the congregation and scatters blessings upon them,dactyl,6
200253,down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal,dactyl,6
200254,wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the ear rings,dactyl,6
200255,brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom,dactyl,6
200256,handed down from mother to child through long generations,dactyl,6
200257,but a celestial brightnessa more ethereal beauty,dactyl,6
200258,shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession,dactyl,6
200259,homeward serenely she walked with god's benediction upon her,dactyl,6
200260,when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music,dactyl,6
200261,firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer,dactyl,6
200262,stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady,dactyl,6
200263,sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it,dactyl,6
200264,rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath,dactyl,6
200265,led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow,dactyl,6
200266,under the sycamore tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,dactyl,6
200267,such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,dactyl,6
200268,built o'er a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary,dactyl,6
200269,farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its moss grown,dactyl,6
200270,bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses,dactyl,6
200271,shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard,dactyl,6
200272,there stood the broad wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows,dactyl,6
200273,there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio,dactyl,6
200274,strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame,dactyl,6
200275,voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter,dactyl,6
200276,bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village in each one,dactyl,6
200277,far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase,dactyl,6
200278,under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft,dactyl,6
200279,there too the dove cot stood with its meek and innocent inmates,dactyl,6
200280,murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes,dactyl,6
200281,numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation,dactyl,6
200282,thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grand pr,dactyl,6
200283,lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household,dactyl,6
200284,many a youth as he knelt in church and opened his missal,dactyl,6
200285,fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion,dactyl,6
200286,happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment,dactyl,6
200287,many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended,dactyl,6
200288,and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,dactyl,6
200289,knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron,dactyl,6
200290,or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village,dactyl,6
200291,bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered,dactyl,6
200292,hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music,dactyl,6
200293,but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome,dactyl,6
200294,gabriel lajeunesse the son of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200295,who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men,dactyl,6
200296,for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations,dactyl,6
200297,has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people,dactyl,6
200298,basil was benedict's friend their children from earliest childhood,dactyl,6
200299,grew up together as brother and sister and father felician,dactyl,6
200300,priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters,dactyl,6
200301,out of the self same book with the hymns of the church and the plain song,dactyl,6
200302,but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed,dactyl,6
200303,swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200304,there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him,dactyl,6
200305,take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,dactyl,6
200306,nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cart wheel,dactyl,6
200307,lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders,dactyl,6
200308,oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness,dactyl,6
200309,bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice,dactyl,6
200310,warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,dactyl,6
200311,and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes,dactyl,6
200312,merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel,dactyl,6
200313,oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle,dactyl,6
200314,down the hillside bounding they glided away o'er the meadow,dactyl,6
200315,oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,dactyl,6
200316,seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow,dactyl,6
200317,brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings,dactyl,6
200318,lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow,dactyl,6
200319,thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children,dactyl,6
200320,he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning,dactyl,6
200321,gladdened the earth with its light and ripened thought into action,dactyl,6
200322,she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman,dactyl,6
200323,sunshine of saint eulalie' was she called for that was the sunshine,dactyl,6
200324,which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples,dactyl,6
200325,she too would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,dactyl,6
200326,filling it with love and the ruddy faces of children,dactyl,6
200327,now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer,dactyl,6
200328,and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters,dactyl,6
200329,birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the ice bound,dactyl,6
200330,desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands,dactyl,6
200331,harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september,dactyl,6
200332,wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel,dactyl,6
200333,all the signs foretold a winter long and inclement,dactyl,6
200334,bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey,dactyl,6
200335,till the hives overflowed and the indian hunters asserted,dactyl,6
200336,cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes,dactyl,6
200337,such was the advent of autumn then followed that beautiful season,dactyl,6
200338,called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of all saints,dactyl,6
200339,filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape,dactyl,6
200340,lay as if new created in all the freshness of childhood,dactyl,6
200341,peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean,dactyl,6
200342,was for a moment consoled all sounds were in harmony blended,dactyl,6
200343,voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farm yards,dactyl,6
200344,whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons,dactyl,6
200345,all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun,dactyl,6
200346,looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him,dactyl,6
200347,while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,dactyl,6
200348,bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest,dactyl,6
200349,flashed like the plane tree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels,dactyl,6
200350,now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness,dactyl,6
200351,day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending,dactyl,6
200352,brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead,dactyl,6
200353,pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other,dactyl,6
200354,and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening,dactyl,6
200355,foremost bearing the bell evangeline's beautiful heifer,dactyl,6
200356,proud of her snow white hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar,dactyl,6
200357,quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection,dactyl,6
200358,then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,dactyl,6
200359,where was their favorite pasture behind them followed the watch dog,dactyl,6
200360,patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct,dactyl,6
200361,walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly,dactyl,6
200362,waving his bushy tail and urging forward the stragglers,dactyl,6
200363,regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector,dactyl,6
200364,when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled,dactyl,6
200365,late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes,dactyl,6
200366,laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor,dactyl,6
200367,cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,dactyl,6
200368,while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,dactyl,6
200369,painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson,dactyl,6
200370,nodded in bright array like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms,dactyl,6
200371,patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders,dactyl,6
200372,unto the milkmaid's hand whilst loud and in regular cadence,dactyl,6
200373,into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended,dactyl,6
200374,lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm yard,dactyl,6
200375,echoed back by the barns anon they sank into stillness,dactyl,6
200376,heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barn doors,dactyl,6
200377,rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent,dactyl,6
200378,in doors warm by the wide mouthed fireplace idly the farmer,dactyl,6
200379,sat in his elbow chair and watched how the flames and the smoke wreaths,dactyl,6
200380,struggled together like foes in a burning city behind him,dactyl,6
200381,nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic,dactyl,6
200382,darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness,dactyl,6
200383,faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his arm chair,dactyl,6
200384,laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser,dactyl,6
200385,caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine,dactyl,6
200386,fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas,dactyl,6
200387,such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him,dactyl,6
200388,sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards,dactyl,6
200389,close at her father's side was the gentle evangeline seated,dactyl,6
200390,spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her,dactyl,6
200391,silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle,dactyl,6
200392,while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe,dactyl,6
200393,followed the old man's song and united the fragments together,dactyl,6
200394,as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,dactyl,6
200395,footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar,dactyl,6
200396,so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked,dactyl,6
200397,thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted,dactyl,6
200398,sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges,dactyl,6
200399,benedict knew by the hob nailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200400,and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him,dactyl,6
200401,welcome' the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold,dactyl,6
200402,welcome basil my friend come take thy place on the settle,dactyl,6
200403,close by the chimney side which is always empty without thee,dactyl,6
200404,take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco,dactyl,6
200405,never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling,dactyl,6
200406,smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams,dactyl,6
200407,round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes',dactyl,6
200408,then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200409,taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside,dactyl,6
200410,benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad,dactyl,6
200411,ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with,dactyl,6
200412,gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them,dactyl,6
200413,happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe',dactyl,6
200414,pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him,dactyl,6
200415,and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued,dactyl,6
200416,four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors,dactyl,6
200417,ride in the gaspereau's mouth with their cannon pointed against us,dactyl,6
200418,what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded,dactyl,6
200419,on the morrow to meet in the church where his majesty's mandate,dactyl,6
200420,will be proclaimed as law in the land alas in the mean time,dactyl,6
200421,many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people',dactyl,6
200422,then made answer the farmer 'perhaps some friendlier purpose,dactyl,6
200423,brings these ships to our shores perhaps the harvests in england,dactyl,6
200424,by untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,dactyl,6
200425,and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children',dactyl,6
200426,not so thinketh the folk in the village' said warmly the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200427,shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued,dactyl,6
200428,louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sjour nor port royal,dactyl,6
200429,many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts,dactyl,6
200430,waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to morrow,dactyl,6
200431,arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds,dactyl,6
200432,nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower',dactyl,6
200433,then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer,dactyl,6
200434,safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,dactyl,6
200435,safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean,dactyl,6
200436,than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemy's cannon,dactyl,6
200437,fear no evil my friend and to night may no shadow of sorrow,dactyl,6
200438,fall on this house and earth for this is the night of the contract,dactyl,6
200439,built are the house and the barn the merry lads of the village,dactyl,6
200440,strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them,dactyl,6
200441,filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth,dactyl,6
200442,ren leblanc will be here anon with his papers and ink horn,dactyl,6
200443,shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children',dactyl,6
200444,as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lover's,dactyl,6
200445,blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,dactyl,6
200446,and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered,dactyl,6
200447,bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean,dactyl,6
200448,bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public,dactyl,6
200449,shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung,dactyl,6
200450,over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows,dactyl,6
200451,sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal,dactyl,6
200452,father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred,dactyl,6
200453,children's children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick,dactyl,6
200454,four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,dactyl,6
200455,suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english,dactyl,6
200456,now though warier grown without all guile or suspicion,dactyl,6
200457,ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike,dactyl,6
200458,he was beloved by all and most of all by the children,dactyl,6
200459,for he told them tales of the loup garou in the forest,dactyl,6
200460,and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,dactyl,6
200461,and of the white ltiche the ghost of a child who unchristened,dactyl,6
200462,died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children,dactyl,6
200463,and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,dactyl,6
200464,and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,dactyl,6
200465,and of the marvellous powers of four leaved clover and horseshoes,dactyl,6
200466,with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village,dactyl,6
200467,then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200468,knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand,dactyl,6
200469,father leblanc' he exclaimed 'thou hast heard the talk in the village,dactyl,6
200470,and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand',dactyl,6
200471,then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,dactyl,6
200472,gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser,dactyl,6
200473,and what their errand may be i know not better than others,dactyl,6
200474,yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention,dactyl,6
200475,brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us',dactyl,6
200476,god's name' shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith,dactyl,6
200477,must we in all things look for the how and the why and the where fore,dactyl,6
200478,daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest',dactyl,6
200479,but without heeding his warmth continued the notary public,dactyl,6
200480,man is unjust but god is just and finally justice,dactyl,6
200481,triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me,dactyl,6
200482,when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal',dactyl,6
200483,this was the old man's favorite tale and he loved to repeat it,dactyl,6
200484,when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them,dactyl,6
200485,once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember,dactyl,6
200486,raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice,dactyl,6
200487,stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand,dactyl,6
200488,and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided,dactyl,6
200489,over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people,dactyl,6
200490,even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,dactyl,6
200491,having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them,dactyl,6
200492,but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted,dactyl,6
200493,might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty,dactyl,6
200494,ruled with an iron rod then it chanced in a nobleman's palace,dactyl,6
200495,that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion,dactyl,6
200496,fell on an orphan girl who lived as a maid in the household,dactyl,6
200497,she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,dactyl,6
200498,patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice,dactyl,6
200499,as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,dactyl,6
200500,lo o'er the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder,dactyl,6
200501,smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand,dactyl,6
200502,down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,dactyl,6
200503,and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,dactyl,6
200504,into whose clay built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven',dactyl,6
200505,silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200506,stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language,dactyl,6
200507,all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors,dactyl,6
200508,freeze in fantastic shapes on the window panes in the winter,dactyl,6
200509,then evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,dactyl,6
200510,filled till it overflowed the pewter tankard with home brewed,dactyl,6
200511,nut brown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grand pr,dactyl,6
200512,while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and ink horn,dactyl,6
200513,wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,dactyl,6
200514,naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle,dactyl,6
200515,orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed,dactyl,6
200516,and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin,dactyl,6
200517,then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table,dactyl,6
200518,three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver,dactyl,6
200519,and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,dactyl,6
200520,lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare,dactyl,6
200521,wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed,dactyl,6
200522,while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,dactyl,6
200523,till evangeline brought the draught board out of its corner,dactyl,6
200524,soon was the game begun in friendly contention the old men,dactyl,6
200525,laughed at each lucky hit or unsuccessful manuvre,dactyl,6
200526,laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the king row,dactyl,6
200527,meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,dactyl,6
200528,sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise,dactyl,6
200529,over the pallid sea and the silvery mists of the meadows,dactyl,6
200530,silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven,dactyl,6
200531,blossomed the lovely stars the forget me nots of the angels,dactyl,6
200532,thus was the evening passed anon the bell from the belfry,dactyl,6
200533,rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway,dactyl,6
200534,rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household,dactyl,6
200535,many a farewell word and sweet good night on the door step,dactyl,6
200536,lingered long in evangeline's heart and filled it with gladness,dactyl,6
200537,carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth stone,dactyl,6
200538,and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer,dactyl,6
200539,soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed,dactyl,6
200540,up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,dactyl,6
200541,lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden,dactyl,6
200542,silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber,dactyl,6
200543,simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes press,dactyl,6
200544,ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded,dactyl,6
200545,linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven,dactyl,6
200546,this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,dactyl,6
200547,better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife,dactyl,6
200548,soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight,dactyl,6
200549,streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden,dactyl,6
200550,swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean,dactyl,6
200551,ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with,dactyl,6
200552,naked snow white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber,dactyl,6
200553,little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard,dactyl,6
200554,waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow,dactyl,6
200555,yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness,dactyl,6
200556,passed o'er her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight,dactyl,6
200557,flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment,dactyl,6
200558,and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass,dactyl,6
200559,forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps,dactyl,6
200560,as out of abraham's tent young ishmael wandered with hagar,dactyl,6
200561,pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grand pr,dactyl,6
200562,pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas,dactyl,6
200563,where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor,dactyl,6
200564,life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor,dactyl,6
200565,knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning,dactyl,6
200566,now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets,dactyl,6
200567,came in their holiday dresses the blithe acadian peasants,dactyl,6
200568,many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk,dactyl,6
200569,made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows,dactyl,6
200570,where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,dactyl,6
200571,group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway,dactyl,6
200572,long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced,dactyl,6
200573,thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors,dactyl,6
200574,sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together,dactyl,6
200575,every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted,dactyl,6
200576,for with this simple people who lived like brothers together,dactyl,6
200577,all things were held in common and what one had was another's,dactyl,6
200578,yet under benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant,dactyl,6
200579,for evangeline stood among the guests of her father,dactyl,6
200580,bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness,dactyl,6
200581,fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it,dactyl,6
200582,under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard,dactyl,6
200583,stript of its golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal,dactyl,6
200584,there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated,dactyl,6
200585,there good benedict sat and sturdy basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200586,not far withdrawn from these by the cider press and the beehives,dactyl,6
200587,michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats,dactyl,6
200588,shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow white,dactyl,6
200589,hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler,dactyl,6
200590,glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers,dactyl,6
200591,gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,dactyl,6
200592,tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunquerque,dactyl,6
200593,and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music,dactyl,6
200594,merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances,dactyl,6
200595,under the orchard trees and down the path to the meadows,dactyl,6
200596,old folk and young together and children mingled among them,dactyl,6
200597,fairest of all the maids was evangeline benedict's daughter,dactyl,6
200598,noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200599,so passed the morning away and lo with a summons sonorous,dactyl,6
200600,sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat,dactyl,6
200601,thronged erelong was the church with men without in the churchyard,dactyl,6
200602,waited the women they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones,dactyl,6
200603,garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest,dactyl,6
200604,then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them,dactyl,6
200605,entered the sacred portal with loud and dissonant clangor,dactyl,6
200606,echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,dactyl,6
200607,echoed a moment only and slowly the ponderous portal,dactyl,6
200608,closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers,dactyl,6
200609,then uprose their commander and spake from the steps of the altar,dactyl,6
200610,holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission,dactyl,6
200611,you are convened this day' he said 'by his majesty's orders,dactyl,6
200612,clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness,dactyl,6
200613,let your own hearts reply to my natural make and my temper,dactyl,6
200614,painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous,dactyl,6
200615,yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch,dactyl,6
200616,namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds,dactyl,6
200617,forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province,dactyl,6
200618,be transported to other lands god grant you may dwell there,dactyl,6
200619,ever as faithful subjects a happy and peaceable people,dactyl,6
200620,prisoners now i declare you for such is his majesty's pleasure',dactyl,6
200621,as when the air is serene in sultry solstice of summer,dactyl,6
200622,suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones,dactyl,6
200623,beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows,dactyl,6
200624,hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs,dactyl,6
200625,bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures,dactyl,6
200626,so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker,dactyl,6
200627,silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose,dactyl,6
200628,louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,dactyl,6
200629,and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway,dactyl,6
200630,vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations,dactyl,6
200631,rang through the house of prayer and high o'er the heads of the others,dactyl,6
200632,rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6
200633,as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows,dactyl,6
200634,flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted,dactyl,6
200635,down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance,dactyl,6
200636,death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests',dactyl,6
200637,more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier,dactyl,6
200638,smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement,dactyl,6
200639,in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,dactyl,6
200640,lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician,dactyl,6
200641,entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar,dactyl,6
200642,raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence,dactyl,6
200643,all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people,dactyl,6
200644,deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful,dactyl,6
200645,spake he as after the tocsin's alarum distinctly the clock strikes,dactyl,6
200646,what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you,dactyl,6
200647,forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you,dactyl,6
200648,not in word alone but in deed to love one another,dactyl,6
200649,is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations,dactyl,6
200650,have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness,dactyl,6
200651,this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it,dactyl,6
200652,thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred,dactyl,6
200653,lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you,dactyl,6
200654,see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion,dactyl,6
200655,hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them,dactyl,6
200656,let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,dactyl,6
200657,let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them',dactyl,6
200658,few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people,dactyl,6
200659,sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,dactyl,6
200660,while they repeated his prayer and said 'o father forgive them',dactyl,6
200661,then came the evening service the tapers gleamed from the altar,dactyl,6
200662,fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded,dactyl,6
200663,not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria,dactyl,6
200664,sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated,dactyl,6
200665,rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven,dactyl,6
200666,meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides,dactyl,6
200667,wandered wailing from house to house the women and children,dactyl,6
200668,long at her father's door evangeline stood with her right hand,dactyl,6
200669,shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending,dactyl,6
200670,lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each,dactyl,6
200671,peasant's cottage with golden thatch and emblazoned its windows,dactyl,6
200672,long within had been spread the snow white cloth on the table,dactyl,6
200673,there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wild flowers,dactyl,6
200674,there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy,dactyl,6
200675,and at the head of the board the great arm chair of the farmer,dactyl,6
200676,thus did evangeline wait at her father's door as the sunset,dactyl,6
200677,threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows,dactyl,6
200678,ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,dactyl,6
200679,and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,dactyl,6
200680,charity meekness love and hope and forgiveness and patience,dactyl,6
200681,then all forgetful of self she wandered into the village,dactyl,6
200682,cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,dactyl,6
200683,as o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,dactyl,6
200684,urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children,dactyl,6
200685,down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors,dactyl,6
200686,veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai,dactyl,6
200687,sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded,dactyl,6
200688,meanwhile amid the gloom by the church evangeline lingered,dactyl,6
200689,all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows,dactyl,6
200690,stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion,dactyl,6
200691,gabriel' cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer,dactyl,6
200692,came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living,dactyl,6
200693,slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father,dactyl,6
200694,smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board was the supper untasted,dactyl,6
200695,empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror,dactyl,6
200696,sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber,dactyl,6
200697,in the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall,dactyl,6
200698,loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore tree by the window,dactyl,6
200699,keenly the lightning flashed and governed the voice of the echoing thunder,dactyl,6
200700,told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created,dactyl,6
200701,then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven,dactyl,6
200702,soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning,dactyl,6
200703,four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day,dactyl,6
200704,cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse,dactyl,6
200705,soon o'er the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession,dactyl,6
200706,came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women,dactyl,6
200707,driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea shore,dactyl,6
200708,pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,dactyl,6
200709,ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland,dactyl,6
200710,close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen,dactyl,6
200711,while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings,dactyl,6
200712,thus to the gaspereau's mouth they hurried and there on the sea beach,dactyl,6
200713,piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants,dactyl,6
200714,all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply,dactyl,6
200715,all day long the wains came laboring down from the village,dactyl,6
200716,late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting,dactyl,6
200717,echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard,dactyl,6
200718,thither the women and children thronged on a sudden the church doors,dactyl,6
200719,opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession,dactyl,6
200720,followed the long imprisoned but patient acadian farmers,dactyl,6
200721,even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country,dactyl,6
200722,sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,dactyl,6
200723,so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended,dactyl,6
200724,down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters,dactyl,6
200725,foremost the young men came and raising together their voices,dactyl,6
200726,sang with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions,dactyl,6
200727,sacred heart of the saviour o inexhaustible fountain,dactyl,6
200728,fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience',dactyl,6
200729,then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside,dactyl,6
200730,joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them,dactyl,6
200731,mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed,dactyl,6
200732,half way down to the shore evangeline waited in silence,dactyl,6
200733,not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction,dactyl,6
200734,calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her,dactyl,6
200735,and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion,dactyl,6
200736,tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him,dactyl,6
200737,clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered,dactyl,6
200738,gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another,dactyl,6
200739,nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen',dactyl,6
200740,smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father,dactyl,6
200741,saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect,dactyl,6
200742,gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep,dactyl,6
200743,heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom,dactyl,6
200744,but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him,dactyl,6
200745,speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not,dactyl,6
200746,thus to the gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession,dactyl,6
200747,there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking,dactyl,6
200748,busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion,dactyl,6
200749,wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children,dactyl,6
200750,left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties,dactyl,6
200751,so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried,dactyl,6
200752,while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father,dactyl,6
200753,half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight,dactyl,6
200754,deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean,dactyl,6
200755,fled away from the shore and left the line of the sand beach,dactyl,6
200756,covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery sea weed,dactyl,6
200757,farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,dactyl,6
200758,like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle,dactyl,6
200759,all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them,dactyl,6
200760,lay encamped for the night the houseless acadian farmers,dactyl,6
200761,back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,dactyl,6
200762,dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving,dactyl,6
200763,inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors,dactyl,6
200764,then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures,dactyl,6
200765,sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders,dactyl,6
200766,lowing they waited and long at the well known bars of the farm yard,dactyl,6
200767,waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milk maid,dactyl,6
200768,silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded,dactyl,6
200769,rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows,dactyl,6
200770,but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,dactyl,6
200771,built of the drift wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest,dactyl,6
200772,round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,dactyl,6
200773,voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children,dactyl,6
200774,onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish,dactyl,6
200775,wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering,dactyl,6
200776,like unto shipwrecked paul on melita's desolate sea shore,dactyl,6
200777,thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father,dactyl,6
200778,and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,dactyl,6
200779,haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion,dactyl,6
200780,e'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken,dactyl,6
200781,vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,dactyl,6
200782,vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not,dactyl,6
200783,but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight,dactyl,6
200784,benedicite' murmured the priest in tones of compassion,dactyl,6
200785,more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents,dactyl,6
200786,faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold,dactyl,6
200787,hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow,dactyl,6
200788,silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,dactyl,6
200789,raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them,dactyl,6
200790,moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals,dactyl,6
200791,then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence,dactyl,6
200792,suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the blood red,dactyl,6
200793,moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and o'er the horizon,dactyl,6
200794,titan like stretches its hundred hands upon the mountain and meadow,dactyl,6
200795,seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together,dactyl,6
200796,broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,dactyl,6
200797,gleamed on the sky and sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead,dactyl,6
200798,columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were,dactyl,6
200799,thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr,dactyl,6
200800,then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting,dactyl,6
200801,whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house tops,dactyl,6
200802,started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled,dactyl,6
200803,these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard,dactyl,6
200804,speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish,dactyl,6
200805,we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grand pr',dactyl,6
200806,loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm yards,dactyl,6
200807,thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle,dactyl,6
200808,came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted,dactyl,6
200809,then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments,dactyl,6
200810,far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska,dactyl,6
200811,when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,dactyl,6
200812,or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river,dactyl,6
200813,such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses,dactyl,6
200814,broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed o'er the meadows,dactyl,6
200815,overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden,dactyl,6
200816,gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them,dactyl,6
200817,and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,dactyl,6
200818,lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the sea shore,dactyl,6
200819,motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed,dactyl,6
200820,slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden,dactyl,6
200821,knelt at her father's side and wailed aloud in her terror,dactyl,6
200822,then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom,dactyl,6
200823,through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber,dactyl,6
200824,and when she awoke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her,dactyl,6
200825,faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her,dactyl,6
200826,pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion,dactyl,6
200827,still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,dactyl,6
200828,reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her,dactyl,6
200829,and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses,dactyl,6
200830,then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people,dactyl,6
200831,let us bury him here by the sea when a happier season,dactyl,6
200832,brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,dactyl,6
200833,then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the church yard',dactyl,6
200834,such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the sea side,dactyl,6
200835,having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,dactyl,6
200836,but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grand pr,dactyl,6
200837,and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,dactyl,6
200838,lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation,dactyl,6
200839,solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges,dactyl,6
200840,twas the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean,dactyl,6
200841,with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward,dactyl,6
200842,then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking,dactyl,6
200843,and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,dactyl,6
200844,leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins,dactyl,6
200845,many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand pr,dactyl,6
200846,when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,dactyl,6
200847,bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile,dactyl,6
200848,exile without an end and without an example in story,dactyl,6
200849,far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed,dactyl,6
200850,scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast,dactyl,6
200851,strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland,dactyl,6
200852,friendless homeless hopeless they wandered from city to city,dactyl,6
200853,from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas,dactyl,6
200854,from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters,dactyl,6
200855,seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean,dactyl,6
200856,deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth,dactyl,6
200857,friends they sought and homes and many despairing heart broken,dactyl,6
200858,asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside,dactyl,6
200859,written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards,dactyl,6
200860,long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,dactyl,6
200861,lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things,dactyl,6
200862,fair was she and young but alas before her extended,dactyl,6
200863,dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway,dactyl,6
200864,marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,dactyl,6
200865,passions long extinguished and hopes long dead and abandoned,dactyl,6
200866,as the emigrant's way o'er the western desert is marked by,dactyl,6
200867,camp fires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine,dactyl,6
200868,something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished,dactyl,6
200869,as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine,dactyl,6
200870,suddenly paused in the sky and fading slowly descended,dactyl,6
200871,into the east again from whence it late had arisen,dactyl,6
200872,sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her,dactyl,6
200873,urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit,dactyl,6
200874,she would commence again her endless search and endeavor,dactyl,6
200875,sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,dactyl,6
200876,sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom,dactyl,6
200877,he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him,dactyl,6
200878,sometimes a rumor a hearsay an inarticulate whisper,dactyl,6
200879,came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward,dactyl,6
200880,sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,dactyl,6
200881,but it was long ago in some far off place or forgotten,dactyl,6
200882,gabriel lajeunesse' they said 'oh yes we have seen him,dactyl,6
200883,he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies,dactyl,6
200884,coureurs des bois are they and famous hunters and trappers',dactyl,6
200885,gabriel lajeunesse' said others 'oh yes we have seen him,dactyl,6
200886,he is a voyageur in the lowlands of louisiana',dactyl,6
200887,then would they say 'dear child why dream and wait for him longer,dactyl,6
200888,are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others,dactyl,6
200889,who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal,dactyl,6
200890,here is baptiste leblanc the notary's son who has loved thee,dactyl,6
200891,many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy,dactyl,6
200892,thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherine's tresses',dactyl,6
200893,then would evangeline answer serenely but sadly 'i cannot,dactyl,6
200894,whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere,dactyl,6
200895,for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway,dactyl,6
200896,many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness',dactyl,6
200897,thereupon the priest her friend and father confessor,dactyl,6
200898,said with a smile 'o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee,dactyl,6
200899,talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted,dactyl,6
200900,if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning,dactyl,6
200901,back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment,dactyl,6
200902,that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain,dactyl,6
200903,patience accomplish thy labor accomplish thy work of affection,dactyl,6
200904,sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike,dactyl,6
200905,therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike,dactyl,6
200906,purified strengthened perfected and rendered more worthy of heaven',dactyl,6
200907,cheered by the good man's words evangeline labored and waited,dactyl,6
200908,still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,dactyl,6
200909,but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered 'despair not',dactyl,6
200910,thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort,dactyl,6
200911,bleeding barefooted over the shards and thorns of existence,dactyl,6
200912,let me essay o muse to follow the wanderer's footsteps,dactyl,6
200913,not through each devious path each changeful year of existence,dactyl,6
200914,but as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley,dactyl,6
200915,far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water,dactyl,6
200916,here and there in some open space and at intervals only,dactyl,6
200917,then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it,dactyl,6
200918,though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur,dactyl,6
200919,happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet,dactyl,6
200920,it was the month of may far down the beautiful river,dactyl,6
200921,past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash,dactyl,6
200922,into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi,dactyl,6
200923,floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen,dactyl,6
200924,it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked,dactyl,6
200925,nation scattered along the coast now floating together,dactyl,6
200926,bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune,dactyl,6
200927,men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay,dactyl,6
200928,sought for their kith and their kin among the few acred farmers,dactyl,6
200929,on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas,dactyl,6
200930,with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician,dactyl,6
200931,onward o'er sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests,dactyl,6
200932,day after day they glided adown the turbulent river,dactyl,6
200933,night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders,dactyl,6
200934,now through rushing chutes among green islands where plumelike,dactyl,6
200935,cotton trees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current,dactyl,6
200936,then emerged into broad lagoons where silvery sand bars,dactyl,6
200937,lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin,dactyl,6
200938,shining with snow white plumes large flocks of pelicans waded,dactyl,6
200939,level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river,dactyl,6
200940,shaded by china trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens,dactyl,6
200941,stood the houses of planters with negro cabins and dove cots,dactyl,6
200942,they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,dactyl,6
200943,where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron,dactyl,6
200944,sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward,dactyl,6
200945,they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine,dactyl,6
200946,soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,dactyl,6
200947,which like a network of steel extended in every direction,dactyl,6
200948,over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress,dactyl,6
200949,met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid air,dactyl,6
200950,waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals,dactyl,6
200951,deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons,dactyl,6
200952,home to their roosts in the cedar trees returning at sunset,dactyl,6
200953,or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter,dactyl,6
200954,lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,dactyl,6
200955,gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,dactyl,6
200956,down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin,dactyl,6
200957,dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them,dactyl,6
200958,and o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,dactyl,6
200959,strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed,dactyl,6
200960,as at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,dactyl,6
200961,far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,dactyl,6
200962,so at the hoof beats of fate with sad forebodings of evil,dactyl,6
200963,shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it,dactyl,6
200964,but evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision that faintly,dactyl,6
200965,floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight,dactyl,6
200966,it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom,dactyl,6
200967,through those shadowy aisles had gabriel wandered before her,dactyl,6
200968,and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer,dactyl,6
200969,then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen,dactyl,6
200970,and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure,dactyl,6
200971,sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle,dactyl,6
200972,wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,dactyl,6
200973,breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest,dactyl,6
200974,soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music,dactyl,6
200975,multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,dactyl,6
200976,over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches,dactyl,6
200977,but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness,dactyl,6
200978,and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence,dactyl,6
200979,then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,dactyl,6
200980,silent at times then singing familiar canadian boat songs,dactyl,6
200981,such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers,dactyl,6
200982,while through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,dactyl,6
200983,far offindistinctas of wave or wind in the forest,dactyl,6
200984,mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator,dactyl,6
200985,thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them,dactyl,6
200986,lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya,dactyl,6
200987,water lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations,dactyl,6
200988,made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus,dactyl,6
200989,lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen,dactyl,6
200990,faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,dactyl,6
200991,and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands,dactyl,6
200992,fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,dactyl,6
200993,near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber,dactyl,6
200994,soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended,dactyl,6
200995,under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin,dactyl,6
200996,safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward,dactyl,6
200997,tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered,dactyl,6
200998,over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar,dactyl,6
200999,swinging from its great arms the trumpet flower and the grapevine,dactyl,6
201000,hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob,dactyl,6
201001,on whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending descending,dactyl,6
201002,were the swift humming birds that flitted from blossom to blossom,dactyl,6
201003,such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it,dactyl,6
201004,filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven,dactyl,6
201005,lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial,dactyl,6
201006,nearer and ever nearer among the numberless islands,dactyl,6
201007,darted a light swift boat that sped away o'er the water,dactyl,6
201008,urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers,dactyl,6
201009,northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver,dactyl,6
201010,at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn,dactyl,6
201011,dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness,dactyl,6
201012,somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written,dactyl,6
201013,gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless,dactyl,6
201014,sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow,dactyl,6
201015,swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island,dactyl,6
201016,but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos,dactyl,6
201017,so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows,dactyl,6
201018,all undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers,dactyl,6
201019,angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden,dactyl,6
201020,swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie,dactyl,6
201021,after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,dactyl,6
201022,as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden,dactyl,6
201023,said with a sigh to the friendly priest 'o father felician,dactyl,6
201024,something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders,dactyl,6
201025,is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition,dactyl,6
201026,or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit',dactyl,6
201027,then with a blush she added 'alas for my credulous fancy,dactyl,6
201028,unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning',dactyl,6
201029,but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered,dactyl,6
201030,daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning,dactyl,6
201031,feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface,dactyl,6
201032,is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden,dactyl,6
201033,therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions,dactyl,6
201034,gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward,dactyl,6
201035,on the banks of the tche are the towns of st maur and st martin,dactyl,6
201036,there the long wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,dactyl,6
201037,there the long absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold,dactyl,6
201038,beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit trees,dactyl,6
201039,under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens,dactyl,6
201040,bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest,dactyl,6
201041,they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana',dactyl,6
201042,with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey,dactyl,6
201043,softly the evening came the sun from the western horizon,dactyl,6
201044,like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape,dactyl,6
201045,twinkling vapors arose and sky and water and forest,dactyl,6
201046,seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together,dactyl,6
201047,hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver,dactyl,6
201048,floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water,dactyl,6
201049,filled was evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness,dactyl,6
201050,touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling,dactyl,6
201051,glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her,dactyl,6
201052,then from a neighboring thicket the mocking bird wildest of singers,dactyl,6
201053,swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,dactyl,6
201054,shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,dactyl,6
201055,that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen,dactyl,6
201056,plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness,dactyl,6
201057,seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes,dactyl,6
201058,single notes were then heard in sorrowful low lamentation,dactyl,6
201059,till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision,dactyl,6
201060,as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops,dactyl,6
201061,shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches,dactyl,6
201062,with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion,dactyl,6
201063,slowly they entered the tche where it flows through the green opelousas,dactyl,6
201064,and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland,dactyl,6
201065,saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling,dactyl,6
201066,sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle,dactyl,6
201067,near to the bank of the river o'ershadowed by oaks from whose branches,dactyl,6
201068,garlands of spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,dactyl,6
201069,such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide,dactyl,6
201070,stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman a garden,dactyl,6
201071,girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,dactyl,6
201072,filling the air with fragrance the house itself was of timbers,dactyl,6
201073,hewn from the cypress tree and carefully fitted together,dactyl,6
201074,large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported,dactyl,6
201075,rose wreathed vine encircled a broad and spacious veranda,dactyl,6
201076,haunt of the humming bird and the bee extended around it,dactyl,6
201077,at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden,dactyl,6
201078,stationed the dove cots were as love's perpetual symbol,dactyl,6
201079,scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals,dactyl,6
201080,silence reigned o'er the place the line of shadow and sunshine,dactyl,6
201081,ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow,dactyl,6
201082,and from its chimney top ascending and slowly expanding,dactyl,6
201083,into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose,dactyl,6
201084,in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway,dactyl,6
201085,through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,dactyl,6
201086,into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending,dactyl,6
201087,full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas,dactyl,6
201088,hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,dactyl,6
201089,stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grape vines,dactyl,6
201090,just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,dactyl,6
201091,mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups,dactyl,6
201092,sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin,dactyl,6
201093,broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero,dactyl,6
201094,gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master,dactyl,6
201095,round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing,dactyl,6
201096,quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness,dactyl,6
201097,that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape,dactyl,6
201098,slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding,dactyl,6
201099,fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded,dactyl,6
201100,wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening,dactyl,6
201101,suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle,dactyl,6
201102,rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean,dactyl,6
201103,silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,dactyl,6
201104,and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance,dactyl,6
201105,then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden,dactyl,6
201106,saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him,dactyl,6
201107,suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward,dactyl,6
201108,rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder,dactyl,6
201109,when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith,dactyl,6
201110,hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden,dactyl,6
201111,there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer,dactyl,6
201112,gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces,dactyl,6
201113,laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful,dactyl,6
201114,thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings,dactyl,6
201115,stole o'er the maiden's heart and basil somewhat embarrassed,dactyl,6
201116,broke the silence and said 'if you came by the atchafalaya,dactyl,6
201117,how have you nowhere encountered my gabriel's boat on the bayous',dactyl,6
201118,over evangeline's face at the words of basil a shade passed,dactyl,6
201119,tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent,dactyl,6
201120,gone is gabriel gone' and concealing her face on his shoulder,dactyl,6
201121,all her o'erburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented,dactyl,6
201122,then the good basil saidand his voice grew blithe as he said it,dactyl,6
201123,be of good cheer my child it is only to day he departed,dactyl,6
201124,foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses,dactyl,6
201125,moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit,dactyl,6
201126,could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence,dactyl,6
201127,thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever,dactyl,6
201128,ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles,dactyl,6
201129,he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,dactyl,6
201130,tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him,dactyl,6
201131,unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards,dactyl,6
201132,thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains,dactyl,6
201133,hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver,dactyl,6
201134,therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover,dactyl,6
201135,he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him,dactyl,6
201136,up and away to morrow and through the red dew of the morning,dactyl,6
201137,we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison',dactyl,6
201138,then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river,dactyl,6
201139,borne aloft on his comrades' arms came michael the fiddler,dactyl,6
201140,long under basil's roof had he lived like a god on olympus,dactyl,6
201141,having no other care than dispensing music to mortals,dactyl,6
201142,far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle,dactyl,6
201143,long live michael' they cried 'our brave acadian minstrel',dactyl,6
201144,as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway,dactyl,6
201145,father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man,dactyl,6
201146,kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured,dactyl,6
201147,hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,dactyl,6
201148,laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters,dactyl,6
201149,much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci devant blacksmith,dactyl,6
201150,all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor,dactyl,6
201151,much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,dactyl,6
201152,and of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them,dactyl,6
201153,each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise,dactyl,6
201154,thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda,dactyl,6
201155,entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil,dactyl,6
201156,waited his late return and they rested and feasted together,dactyl,6
201157,over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended,dactyl,6
201158,all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver,dactyl,6
201159,fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors,dactyl,6
201160,brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight,dactyl,6
201161,then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman,dactyl,6
201162,poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion,dactyl,6
201163,lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco,dactyl,6
201164,thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened,dactyl,6
201165,welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless,dactyl,6
201166,welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one,dactyl,6
201167,here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers,dactyl,6
201168,here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer,dactyl,6
201169,smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water,dactyl,6
201170,all the year round the orange groves are in blossom and grass grows,dactyl,6
201171,more in a single night than a whole canadian summer,dactyl,6
201172,here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies,dactyl,6
201173,here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber,dactyl,6
201174,with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses,dactyl,6
201175,after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests,dactyl,6
201176,no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads,dactyl,6
201177,burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle',dactyl,6
201178,speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,dactyl,6
201179,while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table,dactyl,6
201180,so that the guests all started and father felician astounded,dactyl,6
201181,suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff half way to his nostrils,dactyl,6
201182,but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer,dactyl,6
201183,only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever,dactyl,6
201184,for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate,dactyl,6
201185,cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell',dactyl,6
201186,then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching,dactyl,6
201187,sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda,dactyl,6
201188,it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters,dactyl,6
201189,who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman,dactyl,6
201190,merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors,dactyl,6
201191,friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers,dactyl,6
201192,meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other,dactyl,6
201193,drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together,dactyl,6
201194,but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding,dactyl,6
201195,from the accordant strings of michael's melodious fiddle,dactyl,6
201196,broke up all further speech away like children delighted,dactyl,6
201197,all things forgotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening,dactyl,6
201198,whirl of the giddy dance as it swept and swayed to the music,dactyl,6
201199,dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments,dactyl,6
201200,meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman,dactyl,6
201201,sat conversing together of past and present and future,dactyl,6
201202,while evangeline stood like one entranced for within her,dactyl,6
201203,olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music,dactyl,6
201204,heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness,dactyl,6
201205,came o'er her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden,dactyl,6
201206,beautiful was the night behind the black wall of the forest,dactyl,6
201207,tipping its summit with silver arose the moon on the river,dactyl,6
201208,fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,dactyl,6
201209,like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit,dactyl,6
201210,nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden,dactyl,6
201211,poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions,dactyl,6
201212,unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian,dactyl,6
201213,fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews,dactyl,6
201214,hung the heart of the maiden the calm and the magical moonlight,dactyl,6
201215,seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings,dactyl,6
201216,as through the garden gate and beneath the shade of the oak trees,dactyl,6
201217,passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie,dactyl,6
201218,silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and fire flies,dactyl,6
201219,gleamed and floated away in mingled and infinite numbers,dactyl,6
201220,over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens,dactyl,6
201221,shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship,dactyl,6
201222,save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,dactyl,6
201223,as if a hand had appeared and written upon them 'upharsin',dactyl,6
201224,and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fire flies,dactyl,6
201225,wandered alone and she cried 'o gabriel o my beloved,dactyl,6
201226,art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee,dactyl,6
201227,art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me,dactyl,6
201228,ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie,dactyl,6
201229,ah how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me,dactyl,6
201230,ah how often beneath this oak returning from labor,dactyl,6
201231,thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers,dactyl,6
201232,when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee',dactyl,6
201233,loud and sudden and near the notes of a whippoorwill sounded,dactyl,6
201234,like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets,dactyl,6
201235,farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence,dactyl,6
201236,patience' whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness,dactyl,6
201237,and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded 'to morrow',dactyl,6
201238,bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden,dactyl,6
201239,bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses,dactyl,6
201240,with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal,dactyl,6
201241,farewell' said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold,dactyl,6
201242,see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine,dactyl,6
201243,and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming',dactyl,6
201244,farewell' answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended,dactyl,6
201245,down to the river's brink where the boatmen already were waiting,dactyl,6
201246,thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness,dactyl,6
201247,swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,dactyl,6
201248,blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert,dactyl,6
201249,not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded,dactyl,6
201250,found they the trace of his course in lake or forest or river,dactyl,6
201251,nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain,dactyl,6
201252,rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country,dactyl,6
201253,till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes,dactyl,6
201254,weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord,dactyl,6
201255,that on the day before with horses and guides and companions,dactyl,6
201256,gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies,dactyl,6
201257,far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains,dactyl,6
201258,lift through perpetual snows their lofty and luminous summits,dactyl,6
201259,down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway,dactyl,6
201260,opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,dactyl,6
201261,westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee,dactyl,6
201262,eastward with devious course among the wind river mountains,dactyl,6
201263,through the sweet water valley precipitate leaps the nebraska,dactyl,6
201264,and to the south from fontaine qui bout and the spanish sierras,dactyl,6
201265,fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert,dactyl,6
201266,numberless torrents with ceaseless sound descend to the ocean,dactyl,6
201267,like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations,dactyl,6
201268,spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies,dactyl,6
201269,billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,dactyl,6
201270,bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas,dactyl,6
201271,over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck,dactyl,6
201272,over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses,dactyl,6
201273,fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel,dactyl,6
201274,over them wander the scattered tribes of ishmael's children,dactyl,6
201275,staining the desert with blood and above their terrible war trails,dactyl,6
201276,circles and sails aloft on pinions majestic the vulture,dactyl,6
201277,like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,dactyl,6
201278,by invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens,dactyl,6
201279,here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders,dactyl,6
201280,here and there rise groves from the margins of swift running rivers,dactyl,6
201281,and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert,dactyl,6
201282,climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook side,dactyl,6
201283,and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven,dactyl,6
201284,like the protecting hand of god inverted above them,dactyl,6
201285,into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains,dactyl,6
201286,gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him,dactyl,6
201287,day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil,dactyl,6
201288,followed his flying steps and thought each day to o'ertake him,dactyl,6
201289,sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp fire,dactyl,6
201290,rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall,dactyl,6
201291,when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes,dactyl,6
201292,and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,dactyl,6
201293,hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana,dactyl,6
201294,showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them,dactyl,6
201295,once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered,dactyl,6
201296,into their little camp an indian woman whose features,dactyl,6
201297,wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow,dactyl,6
201298,she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people,dactyl,6
201299,from the far off hunting grounds of the cruel camanches,dactyl,6
201300,where her canadian husband a coureur des bois had been murdered,dactyl,6
201301,touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome,dactyl,6
201302,gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them,dactyl,6
201303,on the buffalo meat and the venison cooked on the embers,dactyl,6
201304,but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions,dactyl,6
201305,worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,dactyl,6
201306,stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering fire light,dactyl,6
201307,flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets,dactyl,6
201308,then at the door of evangeline's tent she sat and repeated,dactyl,6
201309,slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent,dactyl,6
201310,all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses,dactyl,6
201311,much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another,dactyl,6
201312,hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed,dactyl,6
201313,moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,dactyl,6
201314,yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,dactyl,6
201315,she in turn related her love and all its disasters,dactyl,6
201316,mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended,dactyl,6
201317,still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror,dactyl,6
201318,passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis,dactyl,6
201319,mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden,dactyl,6
201320,but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam,dactyl,6
201321,fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,dactyl,6
201322,till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest,dactyl,6
201323,then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation,dactyl,6
201324,told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom,dactyl,6
201325,that through the pines o'er her father's lodge in the hush of the twilight,dactyl,6
201326,breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden,dactyl,6
201327,till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,dactyl,6
201328,and nevermore returned nor was seen again by her people,dactyl,6
201329,silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened,dactyl,6
201330,to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her,dactyl,6
201331,seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress,dactyl,6
201332,slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose,dactyl,6
201333,lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor,dactyl,6
201334,touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland,dactyl,6
201335,with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches,dactyl,6
201336,swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers,dactyl,6
201337,filled with the thoughts of love was evangeline's heart but a secret,dactyl,6
201338,subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,dactyl,6
201339,as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow,dactyl,6
201340,it was no earthly fear a breath from the region of spirits,dactyl,6
201341,seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment,dactyl,6
201342,that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom,dactyl,6
201343,with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished,dactyl,6
201344,early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee,dactyl,6
201345,said as they journeyed along 'on the western slope of these mountains,dactyl,6
201346,dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission,dactyl,6
201347,much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus,dactyl,6
201348,loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him',dactyl,6
201349,then with a sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered,dactyl,6
201350,let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us',dactyl,6
201351,thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains,dactyl,6
201352,just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices,dactyl,6
201353,and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river,dactyl,6
201354,saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission,dactyl,6
201355,under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village,dactyl,6
201356,knelt the black robe chief with his children a crucifix fastened,dactyl,6
201357,high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines,dactyl,6
201358,looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it,dactyl,6
201359,this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches,dactyl,6
201360,of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers,dactyl,6
201361,mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches,dactyl,6
201362,silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching,dactyl,6
201363,knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions,dactyl,6
201364,but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen,dactyl,6
201365,forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower,dactyl,6
201366,slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them,dactyl,6
201367,welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression,dactyl,6
201368,hearing the homelike sounds of his mother tongue in the forest,dactyl,6
201369,and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam,dactyl,6
201370,there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maize ear,dactyl,6
201371,feasted and slaked their thirst from the water gourd of the teacher,dactyl,6
201372,soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered,dactyl,6
201373,nor six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated,dactyl,6
201374,on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes,dactyl,6
201375,told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey',dactyl,6
201376,soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness,dactyl,6
201377,but on evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow flakes,dactyl,6
201378,fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed,dactyl,6
201379,far to the north he has gone' continued the priest 'but in autumn,dactyl,6
201380,when the chase is done will return again to the mission',dactyl,6
201381,then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive,dactyl,6
201382,let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted',dactyl,6
201383,so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow,dactyl,6
201384,mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions,dactyl,6
201385,homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission,dactyl,6
201386,slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other,dactyl,6
201387,days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing,dactyl,6
201388,green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her,dactyl,6
201389,lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming,dactyl,6
201390,cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels,dactyl,6
201391,then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens,dactyl,6
201392,blushed at each blood red ear for that betokened a lover,dactyl,6
201393,but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield,dactyl,6
201394,even the blood red ear to evangeline brought not her lover,dactyl,6
201395,patience' the priest would say 'have faith and thy prayer will be answered,dactyl,6
201396,look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,dactyl,6
201397,see how its leaves are turned to the north as true as the magnet,dactyl,6
201398,this is the compass flower that the finger of god has planted,dactyl,6
201399,here in the houseless wild to direct the traveller's journey,dactyl,6
201400,over the sea like pathless limitless waste of the desert,dactyl,6
201401,such in the soul of man is faith the blossoms of passion,dactyl,6
201402,gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance,dactyl,6
201403,but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly,dactyl,6
201404,only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter,dactyl,6
201405,crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe',dactyl,6
201406,so came the autumn and passed and the winteryet gabriel came not,dactyl,6
201407,blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird,dactyl,6
201408,sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not,dactyl,6
201409,but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted,dactyl,6
201410,sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom,dactyl,6
201411,far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests,dactyl,6
201412,gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river,dactyl,6
201413,and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence,dactyl,6
201414,saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission,dactyl,6
201415,when over weary ways by long and perilous marches,dactyl,6
201416,she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests,dactyl,6
201417,found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin,dactyl,6
201418,thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places,dactyl,6
201419,divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden,dactyl,6
201420,now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions,dactyl,6
201421,now in the noisy camps and the battle fields of the army,dactyl,6
201422,now in secluded hamlets in towns and populous cities,dactyl,6
201423,like a phantom she came and passed away unremembered,dactyl,6
201424,fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey,dactyl,6
201425,faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended,dactyl,6
201426,each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,dactyl,6
201427,leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow,dactyl,6
201428,then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,dactyl,6
201429,dawn of another life that broke o'er her earthly horizon,dactyl,6
201430,as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning,dactyl,6
201431,in that delightful land which is washed by the delaware waters,dactyl,6
201432,guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle,dactyl,6
201433,stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded,dactyl,6
201434,there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty,dactyl,6
201435,and the streets still re echo the names of the trees of the forest,dactyl,6
201436,as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested,dactyl,6
201437,there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile,dactyl,6
201438,finding among the children of penn a home and a country,dactyl,6
201439,there old ren leblanc had died and when he departed,dactyl,6
201440,saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants,dactyl,6
201441,something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,dactyl,6
201442,something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger,dactyl,6
201443,and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers,dactyl,6
201444,for it recalled the past the old acadian country,dactyl,6
201445,where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters,dactyl,6
201446,so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor,dactyl,6
201447,ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining,dactyl,6
201448,thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps,dactyl,6
201449,as from the mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning,dactyl,6
201450,roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us,dactyl,6
201451,sun illumined with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,dactyl,6
201452,so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her,dactyl,6
201453,dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway,dactyl,6
201454,which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance,dactyl,6
201455,gabriel was not forgotten within her heart was his image,dactyl,6
201456,clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him,dactyl,6
201457,only more beautiful made by his death like silence and absence,dactyl,6
201458,into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not,dactyl,6
201459,over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured,dactyl,6
201460,he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent,dactyl,6
201461,patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others,dactyl,6
201462,this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her,dactyl,6
201463,so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices,dactyl,6
201464,suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma,dactyl,6
201465,other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow,dactyl,6
201466,meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour,dactyl,6
201467,thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting,dactyl,6
201468,lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,dactyl,6
201469,where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,dactyl,6
201470,where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected,dactyl,6
201471,night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated,dactyl,6
201472,loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city,dactyl,6
201473,high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper,dactyl,6
201474,day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs,dactyl,6
201475,plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market,dactyl,6
201476,met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings,dactyl,6
201477,then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,dactyl,6
201478,presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,dactyl,6
201479,darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn,dactyl,6
201480,and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september,dactyl,6
201481,flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,dactyl,6
201482,so death flooded life and o'erflowing its natural margin,dactyl,6
201483,spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence,dactyl,6
201484,wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor,dactyl,6
201485,but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger,dactyl,6
201486,only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants,dactyl,6
201487,crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless,dactyl,6
201488,then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands,dactyl,6
201489,now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket,dactyl,6
201490,meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seemed to echo,dactyl,6
201491,softly the words of the lord 'the poor ye always have with you',dactyl,6
201492,thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying,dactyl,6
201493,looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there,dactyl,6
201494,gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,dactyl,6
201495,such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,dactyl,6
201496,or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance,dactyl,6
201497,unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,dactyl,6
201498,into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter,dactyl,6
201499,thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent,dactyl,6
201500,wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse,dactyl,6
201501,sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden,dactyl,6
201502,and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,dactyl,6
201503,that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty,dactyl,6
201504,then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind,dactyl,6
201505,distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church,dactyl,6
201506,while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted,dactyl,6
201507,sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco,dactyl,6
201508,soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit,dactyl,6
201509,something within her said 'at length thy trials are ended',dactyl,6
201510,and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness,dactyl,6
201511,noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants,dactyl,6
201512,moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence,dactyl,6
201513,closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces,dactyl,6
201514,where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside,dactyl,6
201515,many a languid head upraised as evangeline entered,dactyl,6
201516,turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence,dactyl,6
201517,fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison,dactyl,6
201518,and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler,dactyl,6
201519,laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever,dactyl,6
201520,many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time,dactyl,6
201521,vacant their places were or filled already by strangers,dactyl,6
201522,suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,dactyl,6
201523,still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder,dactyl,6
201524,ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers,dactyl,6
201525,and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning,dactyl,6
201526,then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,dactyl,6
201527,that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows,dactyl,6
201528,on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man,dactyl,6
201529,long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples,dactyl,6
201530,but as he lay in the morning light his face for a moment,dactyl,6
201531,seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood,dactyl,6
201532,so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying,dactyl,6
201533,hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,dactyl,6
201534,as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals,dactyl,6
201535,that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over,dactyl,6
201536,motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted,dactyl,6
201537,seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,dactyl,6
201538,darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking,dactyl,6
201539,then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations,dactyl,6
201540,heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded,dactyl,6
201541,whispered a gentle voice in accents tender and saint like,dactyl,6
201542,gabriel o my beloved' and died away into silence,dactyl,6
201543,then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood,dactyl,6
201544,green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them,dactyl,6
201545,village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow,dactyl,6
201546,as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision,dactyl,6
201547,tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,dactyl,6
201548,vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside,dactyl,6
201549,vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered,dactyl,6
201550,died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken,dactyl,6
201551,vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him,dactyl,6
201552,kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom,dactyl,6
201553,sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness,dactyl,6
201554,as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement,dactyl,6
201555,all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow,dactyl,6
201556,all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing,dactyl,6
201557,all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience,dactyl,6
201558,and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,dactyl,6
201559,meekly she bowed her own and murmured 'father i thank thee',dactyl,6
201560,still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow,dactyl,6
201561,side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping,dactyl,6
201562,under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard,dactyl,6
201563,in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed,dactyl,6
201564,daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,dactyl,6
201565,thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever,dactyl,6
201566,thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy,dactyl,6
201567,thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors,dactyl,6
201568,thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey,dactyl,6
201569,still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches,dactyl,6
201570,dwells another race with other customs and language,dactyl,6
201571,only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic,dactyl,6
201572,linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile,dactyl,6
201573,wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom,dactyl,6
201574,in the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy,dactyl,6
201575,maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,dactyl,6
201576,and by the evening fire repeat evangeline's story,dactyl,6
