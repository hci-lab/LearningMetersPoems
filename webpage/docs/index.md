<a href="#APCD" name="APCD" style="text-decoration: none">Arabic Poems Comprehensive Dataset (APCD)</a>
=================

[الموسوعة الشعرية](https://poetry.dctabudhabi.ae)
and 
[ الديوان](https://www.aldiwan.net).
Both are merged into one large dataset. 

The total number of verses is 1,862,046 poetic verses; each verse is labeled by
its meter, the poet who wrote it, and the age which it was written in. There are
22 meters, 3701 poets and 11 ages; and they are Pre-Islamic, Islamic, Umayyad,
Mamluk, Abbasid, Ayyubid, Ottoman, Andalusian, era between Umayyad and Abbasid,
Fatimid and modern. We are only interested in the 16 classic meters which are
attributed to Al-Farahidi, and they are the majority of the dataset with a total
number of 1,722,321 verses.


It is important to note that the verses diacritic states are not consistent, this
means that a verse can carry full, semi diacritics or it can carry nothing.
