# Introduction

1. This repo is our early research on meter classiﬁcation of Arabic and English poems using deep
   recurrent neural networks.

2. To the best of our knowledge, this research on meter classiﬁcation of Arabic poems using deep
   recurrent neural networks (in particular) and machine learning (in general) is **unprecedented**.

3. To the best of our knowledge, as well, the dataset used for this research, which comprises more
   than 1.5 million of verses, is the first and largest publicly available dataset that is ready for
   computational research and is **unprecedented as well**.

# History
* **2017, Sep.** This research project started as a team of six students (under the supervision of
  Dr. Waleed A. Yousef):
  - five undergraduates (Omar Ibrahim, Taha Madbouly, Ali Elkassas, Ali Osama, and Abdallah Elbohy),
    at the Faculty of Computers and Information, Helwan University (FCIH), who were pursuing their
    graduation project as a partial fulfillment of their B.Sc.
  - one graduate student (Moustafa Mahmoud), at Nile University (NU), who was pursuing his thesis as
    a partial fulfillment of his M.Sc.

* **2018, Jun.** The graduation project was defended before the official committee of FCIH.

* **2018, Jul.** The [dataset](https://hci-lab.github.io/ArabicPoetry-1-Private) of this research
  project was published on the `gh-pages` of the [private
  repo](https://github.com/hci-lab/ArabicPoetry-1-Private) of the project, but available with a
  shared link.

* **2018, Dec.** The project's main manuscript, including a link to the dataset, was submitted to
  IEEE, TNNLS.

* **2019, Apr.** The master thesis was defended before the official committee of the NU.

* **2019, May.** The project's [main manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05700) was posted on
  arxiv.

* **2021, Mar.** The [private repo](https://github.com/hci-lab/ArabicPoetry-1-Private) of the
  project was duplicated, with preserving the full development history, and made public, which is
  this present repo.
